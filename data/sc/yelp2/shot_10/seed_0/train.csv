"Was in Phoenix for the weekend for a baseball game and came here based on location and yelp reviews . Only waited about 10 minutes for a table on Saturday morning around 10am , and the wait staff was friendly and attentive on a busy Saturday . Food was super reasonably priced and tasty . Not the best brunch of my life , but definitely great food for a good price ! They had some awesome looking breakfast cocktails , but we did not partake\n\nDefinitely recommend the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich ! ! But I had to split it with my fianc\u00e9 cause it was so heavy ! ! \n\nNote about the place - it is a little hard to find . The entrance is up the stairs on a side street , not on Jefferson , so we walked around the block a couple times before figuring it out ! \n\nWould absolutely recommend to anyone in the area !",1,positive
"If you like dark crowded hallways that play music way too loud , than this is the place for you . This place is way too small for the amount of people they let in and there is no dance area but plenty of music to dance to . During the day it 's not to bad but avoid when there is line out front because it will be way too crowded and impossible to get a drink .",0,negative

We ate here on Tuesday 03/06/2012 . The service was poor the food was okay but I have to say they really made me mad . My wife ordered the chicken parmesan with the sald bar . Then found out that what you do n't eat you can NOT have a to go box . I can under stand them not letting you take your sald home but you ca n't take you left over chicken parmesan ? ? ? That 's just crazy I would understand it was a all you can eat but it 's not . I will never go back again .,0,negative
"It does n't look like much from the outside ; in fact , Zack 's looks like it 's in need of a facelift , but do n't let that deter you . Zack 's makes some of the best burgers in town . Quick , relatively inexpensive , and absolutely delicious . \n\nTry the Zack 's Special ; basically it 's what a Big Mac should taste like , if McDonald 's were actually in the business of making real burgers . And it 's probably cheaper than a Big Mac , too . \n\nZack 's is no-frills . No fancy menus , no fancy sauces , just good old-fashioned burgers and hot dogs and fries done right . There 's also fried chicken and ribeye sandwiches to be had ; I might have to sample them the next few times I go back to Zacks 's . \n\nIn short , Zack 's is an institution , and rightly so . You do n't stay in business this long by making bad burgers .",1,positive
I am a big fan of this place . Ive driven by many times and have looked forward to attending an event there . We were finally given the chance for a friend 's surprise birthday party . I assisted with the party setup and had the chance to speak with Noah 's staff . They were very helpful and they have a beautiful facility .,1,positive
"I was looking for a new dry cleaner so I gave Polo Cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews . I was disappointed by the high prices - $ 5 to dry clean a man 's dress shirt , $ 7.50 for a blazer and $ 12.50 for a two piece suit ( pants/jacket ) . The high prices might have been justified for same day service , but it was standard two day service .",0,negative
"SO convenient to eat here if you are staying at Bill 's . Down the elevator and there you are ! The triple decker club was really good , the waiter brought us a ton of ranch ( hey , that 's important ) , and they had a really good selection of other sandwiches , burgers , and salads . Great for a bite out before EDC !",1,positive
"You 're better off walking a couple blocks East and going to Jordan 's . Way better sports bar atmosphere , better deals , more bar games and waaaaaay better food . Lucky 's is a sad shell of the former Oakcrest , which was always a favorite in the neighborhood . There is the occasional good drink special and the food can be hit or miss . All the stadium area bars have their niche , but I ca n't name one thing that Lucky 's does really well . Yet , even though I do n't have anything good to say I ca n't really badmouth it too much either . It is just kinda bland , boring and wholly mediocre .",0,negative

"`` If you are going for viewing pleasure or dessert , PERFECT ! If you are going for an actual meal ... do n't . The kids love this place , but they are also eating grilled cheese or chicken strips , hard to screw up . The \ `` `` `` `` adult\ `` `` `` `` food is bland at best . \nFun tables , fun views , and the merry-go-round is a plus , but just go for snacks . ``",0,negative
Ok so I 'm not big on trying new things . I try new things but I 'm always afraid I wo n't like it . I guess you can say I am an adventure but in denial ! Hehe . Ok so my boyfriend loves loves to try anything . First time I cam here I got a ceaser ckn salad and it was awesome I will say . Second time we came here his sister was in town with her boyfriend from Massachusetts visiting . Beer is awesome so I hear from my boyfriend and his sis and her boyfriend . I like wheat beers so I 'm picky . But I wo n't say the beer is n't good just because I am a selective person . Ok so we all got pastes I got a salmon asparagus one and I ca n't remember what everyone else got but I will def say there was no complaints coming from anyone ! I am normally good at not over stuffing myself but this was to good to pass up ! Haha . Service was great ! Was sat immediately maybe a min for them to get our drinks which was great ! No complaints here . Dont eat to much you come here or your missing out on the pastes !,1,positive
Do not use this company ! Bought a living social deal that seems like a scam as I have called 7 times to try and book with no returned call . If you too bought the deal file a complaint with living social ASAP .,0,negative
"Went at 5:30pm on a Wednesday so crowd was light , service was pleasant and responsive , and food came out fast ( majority in ~5-10 min ) .\n\nAtmosphere was like eating in a hotel lobby/lounge ( which you are ) .\n\nFood was so so . In order of preference : \n\nStuffed piquillo peppers - bright acidity of tomato sauce well grounded by goat cheese\nWhite ceviche - tons of lime ( almost soupy ) but with great texture and flavor ( suprising amount of spice ) \nAlbondigas - light fine crumbly texture but short on flavor\nBrava potatoes - soft on inside and light crisp on outside ; go well with garlic aoili and creamy tomato sauce\nGrilled calamari - meh ... it 's just a miniature grilled ( not even sliced ) squid wih some lime and garlic and garnishing\nPintxo de chorizos - little smokies on a bed of mashed potatoes\nAhi tuna tempura - too much going on in this dish.. it was just weird.. go to a sushi place instead",0,negative

"`` Disappointed . Portions are small , prices are high . I started out with a pomegranate gimlet which had a very good taste , I do n't like flavored liqueur , and this was gin and pom juice and lime juice , but I basically paid $ 10 for juice , same with my second cocktail . I 'm a lightweight so I can tell when there is alcohol or no alcohol in my drinks . For my meal I had the pluck university stuffed which was ground chicken stuffed with mozzarella with a red chili chutney , slaw and a taro bun . Sounds good on paper , right ? It fell apart immediately and I had to eat it with a knife and fork , and the chutney was too strong for this \ `` `` `` `` burger\ `` `` `` `` . My sweet potato fries were burnt , not edible . The entire table got a different order of fries so we could all try them , the gravy fries were probably the best . \n\nOur server needed some extra training , we had a table of 7 girls , he acted very scared to approach us , he would drop stuff and run , as if he was nervous to ask if we needed anything else . Not sure if he is new or what , but needs some people skills . The overall con census at the table was this place is n't worth it . If I want a burger I will stick with bachi burger or the burger bar . ``",0,negative
"Thought I reviewed this place already . Since it 's been about a year and a half since I last ate here ( twice visited , ate once ) , I plan to give SK another try very soon . Thought I 'd just get the ball rolling now ... \n\nI met with a few people here the first time , but was n't feeling hungry enough , so I just joined in the conversations and just observed the food as they were delivered to the table . Most of my companions that night did n't actually order sushi , and instead , opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes . The low menu prices did pique my interest , so when hunger pangs struck me a couple of hours later , I asked relatives if they wanted to join me for sushi ( and they did ) .\n\nAs noted in the number of stars I posted above , I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening . I found the sushi ( vinegared rice ) lacking in the flavor department , and the roll ingredients to be subpar . The selections we shared between us were so bland , I ca n't even recall which rolls and nigiri we had ordered ! \n\nSince it 's been almost two years , and a lot can change in two years ( for good or bad ) , I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try .",0,negative
I have been going to Grand Paws for several years . The staff are all friendly and helpful . All Vets are nice but I really like Dr. St Clair . He is very caring and good with my cats.\nI think their prices are better than most places . Their new clinic is very nice and I like the bigger space .,1,positive
"Kobe beef , shaved truffles , foie gras , Madeira sauce . How can you go wrong ? ? ! ! Oh and a fried egg ! ! ! This was absolutely the best damn burger I have EVER eaten ! ! ! ! Forget the $ 60 price tag ... it was worth it ! ! ! ! This is one of those bucket list items . Highly recommend everyone have one once in their lives .",1,positive
