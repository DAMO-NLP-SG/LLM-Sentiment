"I have been to this location multiple times and every time the service is horrendous and the food is mediocre . Not sure if the location being in a mall has to do with it , but stay away unless you are really disparate for some grub .",0,negative
"This place is the bomb ! Had so much fun . First , the people who complain about this place are nuts . If you have seen one pawn shop you have seen them all ? Not here , no way . How many pawn shops do you know carry 1881 colt 45 revolvers for sale ? How many pawn shops have never before released photos of Jimmy Hendrix hanging on the wall for sale ? How many pawn shops have people lined up for a block to get in ? oh and Super Bowl rings for sale ? Nuf said . If you like the show , like the business of pawn and like the guys you will love this place . I came from Cincinnati and sold a gold ring and got 40 % more than a gold party would offer me . will you get to see th guys . Maybe . We saw Big Haus and the Old Man . Best to come weekdays from 9-4 . Good selection of items to look through . Rocco helped me buy a the aforementioned colt 45 and he was super cool . All the people who we waited in line with were very friendly . Shady part of town ? Maybe if you live in the Hanptons and have never left your house . I say where do you wanted it located ? Duh . yes they sell gifts . I call this good business . I will be back again !",1,positive

Great service,1,positive
"`` I have had some very interesting times at the Spearmint Rhino , and despite still being one of the \ `` `` `` `` big names\ `` `` `` `` in the industry , the place has gone downhill in the past couple of years . It 's still one of the best clubs during the weekend or when they have a Headliner performing , but other clubs have just as much or more to offer . \n\nThe Spearmint Rhino does have some of the better looking dancers in Vegas , but most of them are very unfriendly and their hustle is so obvious that it 's a turnoff . I realize that it 's a job , but I 'm used to the ladies buttering up the customers and chatting them up before asking for a dance - not asking and then immediately leaving . Many of the ladies sat by themselves and appeared disinterested . \n\nMy most recent visit was a nightmare . ( I go to Strip Clubs to check out very attractive women , 8+ ... if you know what I mean . ) On this particular visit , there was n't even a 7 in the entire club , and I 'm usually a bit forgiving . This is not a knock on the ladies - just an honest assessment of the club . On top of the disappointment , all of the ladies were cold as ice . I completely understand the economics of a Strip Club , that 's why I walk in with my \ `` `` `` `` strip club\ `` `` `` `` roll , but the cold disinterested thing only works for the irresistibly hot women ... not for the women working that night . \n\nI purchased a soda - tipped the waitress . Nobody came up to me during the 10 minutes that I sipped on my soda , so I left after being in there for a total of 15-20 minutes . I usually play a game , like \ `` `` `` `` the next lady to talk to me will get $ 20 , \ `` `` `` `` but nobody came up to me before I left . I actually gave one of the dancers a few bucks on my out of the restroom because I ca n't leave without tipping at least one dancer . By the way , the dancers on stage were some of the worst I 've seen in a while - in terms of attitude . Some of them actually stood and did nothing because the action around the stage was weak.\n\nBased on my last visit , I would not dare a return visit , but I have had good times here so I am willing to give it another try . Keep in mind that there are other major clubs in the area with equally hot women . ``",0,negative
"If I was able to give less than one star I would . This is the most pathetic customer service provider I have ever dealt with . You 'll spend more time and money actually trying to get their service to work . 2 service visits , 4 phone calls with hours spent going in circles , and the internet service can not be fixed . Do yourself a favor and stay away .",0,negative
"First of all -- these sandwiches taste like nothing . OK , they taste like fattening mayo and dull , crunchy iceburg lettuce . This to me is the epitome of bland American fare ... . no culinary flare whatsoever and so unhealthy for you . \n\nIt 's a shame that people ca n't find a more delicious sandwich option in town . We have so many ! If the only reason you like this place is because it 's fast ... then I 'm sorry .",0,negative
"First..they have Happy hour 7 days a week . WooHoo ! 1st time was on a lazy weekend afternoon for Happy Hour . The sushi rolls on the menu were decent but not all that elaborate , your basic rolls..so I think I would prefer the extended menu . However what I wish to absolutely rave about is the $ 2 Roka Burger offered at Happy Hour . Best freakin burger , I ca n't even tell you.. but I will try and at a sushi place no less ! ! The meat tastes like it was soaked in a broth that is unbelievable , with a hint of wasabi . Topped with avocado..it 's just amazing . I will be back for the burger alone and I want to try this Hamachi Chili Roll that everyone 's talking about.\n\nP.S . I wo n't give any restaurant 5 stars unless Ive been there at least 3 times and they remain consistent.. hence the 4 star .",1,positive

Nice staff in here . I like to go in and support this store because it 's giving back to our community and once in a while you can find some nice things in here . I also like to bring them things I do n't need anymore . They do take donations at this location . : ) So please go down and help support them . Thank you all and as a bonus its in the same parking lot as Nakato which has great sushi and Hibachi . How can you go wrong really ? ? ?,1,positive
"The best . My 2 young girls ca n't stay away and it is often something special that we do when we have a friend over or have just had a really bad day and need gelato to tun it around . My girls also collect the cute flutted plastic cups that they serve the gelato in . Great place , ( atmosphere is simple ) but product if superior . Very friendly staff too .",1,positive
"`` I was looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant close to work and stumbled across Susie 's . Similar in price to Filiberto 's but the serving sizes were n't quite as big as Filiberto 's is ( that 's fine with me ; I actually prefer \ `` `` `` `` normal\ `` `` `` `` serving sizes . ) Loved the soft tacos ! Ate there while on lunch break so did n't get to try the 1 cent beer with lunch , but made me want to go back on a Saturday to check it out ! ``",1,positive
"Do not stay here . I reserved two rooms at this hotel for my family based on the positive reviews on yelp . It was horrible . 1 ) High resort fees on two rooms , 2 ) the rooms were spacious but they smelled of vomit and tobacco and they gave us only one towel per room , 3 ) our room was not ready until 6:00 pm and the pool closed at 8:00 pm , 4 ) the rooms were far apart from each other , 5 ) only one elevator worked with hundreds of teens at a conference riding up and down , 6 ) too far from the strip , 7 ) no vending and ice machines , 8 ) no prices on in-room refrigerator , and 9 ) the place was like O'Hare airport . It was not relaxing . When I complained to the desk , they apologized and said they had a lot of kids this weekend . Unbelievable . I will never stay here again .",0,negative
The food is still great but the hostess rude . Poor customer service for the hostesses . Good servers . Food came out quick . Tastes great . Too bad the hostess put me off right from the start .,0,negative
"First of all , I am not a friend nor do I know any body personally who works here . I was reading the obscure review of a previous student and thought to myself , wow that is very unnecessary . As a customer , which is all that should matter on this site , hence what yelp is for , I will say my experience here today was nice . I had lowered my expectations because this is a school and I understand that students are learning and practicing , but I came to realize they do a MUCH better job than ANY other school I 've been to in the past . My stylists name was kaylee or kylee ( not sure how to spell it ) and she was very sweet , and most importantly did a good job . She listened to me , she knew what she was doing and I certainly did n't get any bad vibes from the surroundings . Everyone seemed to be busy working on things or clients or cleaning or doing something of the sort . I have gone to the school before in the past , when it was located by fashion square and I must say this new location surely is a step up . I am impressed . I liked it a lot . My color came out better than expected and I really like the cut too ... better than my last few hair cuts that I paid too much $ for . I will definitely be coming back and seeing kaylee ( kylee ? ) again hopefully if she is still here . She did a great job and I 'm happy . Thanks Tony & Guy : )",1,positive
"`` I love dancing ! It 's been a while since I 've gone out and where I 've been out in Arizona . My friend and I planned our annual Scottsdale dance night and this year the best night for us ended up on Wednesday . \n\nI could tell it had been a LONG time since I 've done the club scene since most of my old stomping ground was either permanently closed , getting remodeled , or just closed on \ `` `` `` `` hump day.\ `` `` `` `` Myst was the only club open in the Old Town Scottsdale area . When we got there , they told us that it was 18 and up on Wednesday nights and that people do n't really show up until 11:30pm . It 's also a $ 10 cover . Also , if you check your coat it 's an additional $ 5 . The 21 and older crowd can go upstairs and get drinks . \n\nThe dance floor is a pretty good size ; however , the music was n't the best and seemed like the same thing over and over . I like current songs that you can occasionally sing along to and I think there was maybe one by Beyonce . \n\nThe crowd was young and many were all over each other . It made me embarrassed for some of the women there and then disappointed in the men for trying to handle women inappropriately . It is unusual for me to leave a club early and to not dance , but this was just not a good vibe or crowd . Whatever happened to dress nicely ? Many of the guys just showed up in jeans and a flannel shirt . Seriously . The club looked warn and not kept up ( e.g . , holes in walls , could use a new paint job in the bathrooms , and not all the lights were on ) . \n\nDancing is fun , but not for me at Myst . Maybe it 's the economy , but Myst has seen its better days and it 's going to take a lot to get back to that . ``",0,negative
"So here 's my deal . \nLast time I was in Vegas I was part of a bachlorette party and promoters approached us nonstop . \nThis time around I was nervous because I would be going to Vegas with the family.\nThe familia agreed to watch the kids for one night while the hubs and I partied it up . \nBUT ! ! ! \nPromoters do n't approach you if you 're surrounded by kids and grandparents . \nThats a fact . \nSo I contacted Stacia and she was freakin AWESOME . She hooked up my husband and I with VIP entrance into XS ! ! ! ! \n\nNext time I 'm in Vegas , whether with the family or a big ol group of girls , I 'm definitely contacting Stacia . . . .AND YOU SHOULD TOO ! ! ! ! ! !",1,positive

Love.\nI only wish it was easier to access for locals . This one is on the strip & not easy to get to . I parked at Cosmo & walked over . Took about ten-fifteen min.\n\nI had the pomegranate with Pom sauce & blueberries ! Such good quality and fresh ingredients . I like that the toppings are done for you . It just seems more sanitary . ( I hate buffets ) \n\nPraying for a local shop soon ! \nTOWN SQUARE !,1,positive
"`` The Pros : Pretty flower balls when you walk in . Nice pool area , but when we 're in Vegas , we never go to the pool . Room service food was excellent.\n\nThe Cons : \n\nNOISE . I could n't sleep at the Wynn . This place is all about appearances . It LOOKS nice when you walk in , but it 's poorly insulated . Our room shook every time our neighbors closed their door and it sounded like they were slamming it . Compared to our stays at the Aria , Bellagio , MGM - you can hear a pin drop . The other major noise issue was the wind . Silly , I know , but the wind outside was so loud I could NOT sleep . The Wynn told us it was their \ `` `` `` `` windy season\ `` `` `` `` and the desk lady commented she 's a heavy sleeper so it does n't bother her . I am a light sleeper , but my husband is an incredibly heavy sleeper and the wind and door slamming woke him up too . I 've stayed at top floors in many Vegas hotels - I 've never been kept awake by the wind whistling . I think the Wynn is just poorly insulated ! \n\nGAMBLING SUCKS . Again , I 'm used to MGM with a seemingly endless amount of tables to choose from . The casino is rather small and the table minimums are high . During the day , you will be hard-pressed to find more than one table under a $ 25 minimum . It 's even difficult to find many tables to choose from in the $ 25 range . The table minimum is no problem for my husband , but I do n't like to bet that high . The MGM allows me to bet lower and he can bet as high as he wants . We were there with a big group for a birthday this time , and this was a huge problem since most people were not wanting to bet that high during the day . MGM and Aria are much more accommodating to a group.\n\nLOCATION . Again , I prefer the excellent location at MGM and Aria . When we want to venture out of the hotel , we 've found it to be easy to walk to a ton of nearby casinos . The Wynn was not convenient for us . It 's walking distance to Treasure Island ? blech.\n\nThe Wynn is all about appearances and it falls so far short of the mark I ca n't imagine ever returning . Most importantly , I did n't sleep for 3 days because of the noise issues with this hotel . Do n't believe that just because you 're spending a small fortune to stay here you 're going to get luxury . You 're not . ``",0,negative
