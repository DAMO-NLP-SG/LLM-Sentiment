"Casino awesome ! Rooms , HORRIBLE ! ... \n\nMake sure you bring a full body condom if u plan on sleeping here , or perhaps create your own from recycled ones found in your room . No tide stick is big enough to clean the stains on the furniture and I thought my mind was playing games w me but in retrospect , the bedsheets were untucked upon arrival ! My legs were sore from standing in my room and made sure I put my sneakers on for the long walk out of the bathroom to my suitcase in the other room , \n \nThe casino was actually pretty cool but there is only one visible cashier all the way at the back which I thought was lame.\n\nWould n't stay here again !",0,negative
Always fun and good food . We come here every year during NFR . The only thing was this year the steaks were not as big and juicey as I remember . Sorry .,1,positive
"`` I 'd heard mixed reviews on MSK so on our regular Friday lunches out , my companion and I decided to see for ourselves and went there yesterday . Atmosphere okay , service Outstanding , food marginal at best . Interesting as we arrived we were 1st offered the bar to sit at , mmmmm , interesting offer , but we declined as the place was 1/3 empty , we opted for a table . As I said the service was outstanding and we could have wanted for nothing more , except better food . Kitschy but limited lunch menu , my companion said \ `` `` `` `` interesting that the menu is 3/4 alcohol\ `` `` `` `` so she opted for the Salmon , Apple , and Brie flatbread , and I had the burger . I always search for the perfect burger . Well this was not it . Impressive yes , muddled flavors YES . Huge bun , green chilies , cheddar cheese , large juicy patty with no flavor and a grilled onion made up the offering . The flat bread was beautiful but so salt laden all my friend did is drink water the rest if the day to not dry up from the inside out . I 'd possibly recommend MSK for cocktails after work , but for a meal , I 'll not be back . We 'd had such an AMAZING lunch last week at Searsucker in Fashion Square ( fir less $ 's ) which made our trip to MSK seem so insignificant and not worth the calories . Hopefully something can be done to 'right the ship ' at MSK , as DC Ranch Marketplace is ripe for another restaurant to compliment the offerings there . \nSo do n't say I did n't warn you ! ``",0,negative
I went in for laser removal and the whole skin design family was great ! Anthony made me feel very comfortable with the whole process keeping me informed as far as what to expect . Prior during and after the procedure . Definitely a place you should check out . Will go back for more . Also all the artist are very good and award winning . I have a bunch of ink by Pako n we recently won a bunch of awards at the Philadelphia tattoo convention . Skin design best shop in town .,1,positive

"Excellent choice if you want to stay centrally on the Strip and not shell out huge bucks . It 's not CHEAP , but it 's no Caesar 's . The amenities are n't as grand , but how long are you in your room/hotel and look at what 's in walking distance : Bellagio , Paris , Bally 's , Casear 's , Mirage , TI , Wynn . It 's awesome . I recommend my friends stay here if they 're staying on the Strip .",1,positive
"Our experience with the office staff has been unpleasant every time , both on the phone and in person for visits . The wait is always long ( atleast an hour , even first thing in the morning ) and it takes forever to get your questions answered . \nThey are incompetent when it comes to billing/insurance issues and have completely overlooked our past records from other pediatricians ( which would have given our child 4 immunizations that he 'd already been given . ) In order to get an immunization record , we needed to make an appointment for an office visit . \nThe pediatrician was short with us , seemed annoyed with any questions , and basically told us to go to the ER if we had a concern . \nWe are never coming back here . This place came recommended , but apparently it 's not for informed parents who want to be involved in their child 's healthcare .",0,negative
"As many Yelpers have seemed to notice , GREAT beer selection ! ! = ) I always end up having high-quality nerdy science conversations with the bartender , so two thumbs up for service in my book as well .",1,positive
"`` Made the mistake of taking my car here for an oil change . Then figured I 'd get tires . That 's simple stuff right ? Wrong . After 3 visits they kept \ `` `` `` `` forgetting\ `` `` `` `` to reset the oil gauge . They stated that they replaced two tires and rotated the one tire that needed replacing . Lie . That \ `` `` `` `` replaced\ `` `` `` `` tire blew out on the I-15 two weeks later . I let the tow truck guy keep the rim like a dunce . Went back and they claimed they would show me the video of them rotating the tires . I called their bluff . Suddenly it 's against store policy . I buy a new rim and two new tires trying to keep it consistent . Two days later warning lights come on . I take it to a reputable shop and they ask \ `` `` `` `` what idiots put a bigger rim and tire on the front of your car ? \ `` `` `` `` Ryan , the manager is clearly incompetent . I had to go back and ask him why they did n't put the wheel covers back on and why the light was still on . Bill , the other manager swore he would review the video himself and make sure they rotated the tires properly . I 'll hold my breath Bill . He then instructed Ryan to refund $ 40 as a discount . Ryan then charges me an additional $ 40 . These people can not perform simple services . You have been warned . ``",0,negative

"I would stay away from this place on Friday/Saturday as it is crowded and even if you have table reserved they are weird about when your group/people are coming and you cant be at the bar and the table ? I went on a recent Friday night and I can tell you I was in no mood to be told where I could stand , sit , etc . I have no plans on returning due to this experience ( with a reservation ) . There are other places for me .",0,negative
Excellent pastries and service ! Love the staff . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !,1,positive
"`` My husband and I were invited by friends back in November 2012 . At first we really enjoyed it , then started noticing unprofessional attitude by the owner , such as alcohol on the breath , and shouting at the staff in front of patrons . \n\nThe owner 's claims that former patrons just \ `` `` `` `` hung out\ `` `` `` `` without purchasing anything is erroneous and inflammatory ; furthermore , these patrons are personally responsible for bringing in many new customers.\n\nI fully expect to have the owner remove this negative review ; that is his prerogative . However , just know this ... word gets around Marco . ``",0,negative
"The baby and I decided to take a peek at this Korean market . Everyone was very friendly and the store was nice and clean . I felt strangely comfortable in the store , making sure to check out everything they had in there . Ever since we ( me + hubby ) were stationed in Korea back in the day , I 've been looking for those little bottles that had the magic hangover potion , Bacchus-D. FOUND IT ! Had no idea what it was called , but recognized the bottle and the box . It was also on sale , yay for paying less money for things that I would have payed full price for ! We also picked-up some OB & Hi-Lite , for memory sake . The hubby much appreciated it.\n\nSo the baby fell asleep while her mommy was wondering the aisles , so I stopped by their food court . There were many places to choose from , but I decided to grab something from the one non-Korean place , I Love Oshi . I picked up their udon special with a spicy ahi tuna roll . Not too bad , but I did love the nice and runny poached egg in my soup.\n\nWe will be back and maybe , if he behaves , we 'll bring the hubby/daddy along too !",1,positive
"I have two cats and five Ferrets , and Dr. Molina and her team have been amazing with them .

This Team of wonderful caring and very knowledgeable women make my life with my little farm a happy one .",1,positive
"This was my first time coming to this Hot Bagels & Deli location or any other location . It will also be my last time coming to any Hot Bagels & Deli location . I purchased a Restaurant.com Certificate and tried to use it at this store only to be greeted with a bunch of crap about the certificate . \n\nFirst , I was told that it had expired , actually they never expire and it says so on the certificate . Second , I was told that people keep bringing in copies of the certificate . Now that 's a great way to endear a customer to your business , accuse them of lying and trying to cheat you . By the way , stupid counter person , there is a registration number on the certificate and a phone number for Restaurant.com where you can verify the certificate is valid . \n\nWhile standing there , the woman called someone , I assume the owner ( Bruce ? ) and when she hung up I was told that they do n't take Restaurant.com certificates any longer , but she would do me a FAVOR and take this one , this time . I was also told that I could not use it to purchase the $ 17.00 worth of sandwiches I had ordered . I would have to buy all of the various parts of the sandwiches I wanted and make them myself ; another requirement that is not listed on the certificate . I guess the profit margin is bigger on the parts of the sandwich than it is on a store made sandwich . This is a pretty penny pinching way of doing business . \n\nObviously , the people behind the counter do n't know what they are doing and have no concept of how to handle a Restaurand.com certificate . Obviously , the owner has his own ideas of how to handle these certificates . So , to the owner ( Bruce ? ) , you made a huge mistake this morning by not living up to your responsibilities to redeem my certificate . The certificate was issued without all of the crap restrictions you placed on it once I entered your store , so you are either stupid or arrogant to think that you can treat customers poorly and get away with it . \n\nI walked out of your store this morning and my money walked out with me . I will never enter your store again , and I will make it my life 's work to tell anyone that will listen , just what a jerk you are and how poorly I was treated by you and your employees . I may not cost you a lot of business , but I will cost you some . I will also lodge a complaint with Restaurants.com about the treatment I received in your store . They need to know how you treat their customers . By the way , I rated you a one only because I ca n't rate you a zero .",0,negative
