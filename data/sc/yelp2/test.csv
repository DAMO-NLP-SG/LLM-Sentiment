28631,"I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes . I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum . If I could describe the food in one word-terrible ! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum . It seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat . The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles ( noodles were stuck together ) saturated with soy sauce for color , and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms , green onions and fine threads of carrots . And yes , portions were small , but that 's not really the worst part of the whole experience . Just poorly prepared , way overpriced Chinese food ... sorry .",0,negative

26464,"If you value your life , do n't go to Banner Boswell . My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor 's office . He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m . He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems . When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon , his blood pressure was 177/87 , and he had not been offered anything to eat . I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds . They said I had to wait for the doctor . The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left . An hour later , he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated . I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor had n't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low . I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor 's appointment . My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room . His blood pressure was still sky high ; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds . I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down . At 9:30 p.m. he still had n't received medication or food . The next morning when I went to visit , they had him on a sodium chloride drip . I do n't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200 . He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated . We will never go to this hospital again",0,negative
9477,"`` Before getting started , I 'd like to point out that I am currently sitting in the Palms Casino , while watching my degenerate , gambleholic , asshole-of-a-friend Pete grab his ankles , as the craps table continues to sodomize his life savings . The Palms Casino may as well be a priest , and with each roll of the dice , my man Pete is looking more and more like an alter boy . An alter boy with an ugly hat . As I look at this hat , I noticed a consistent theme . This hat of his will soon be joined by his pockets , as they both prevent the world from seeing what lies beneath -- nothing . What was once there , is now missing , and it is n't pretty . Nor was it smart . With just seven strands of hair , Pete has a face incapable of pulling off the 7-Strand comb-over . So money , combined with the freedom offered in Vegas to dive head-first into a hooker , was Pete 's only hope to hump . Do n't get me wrong , P never planned on returning to Phoenix with any money , which was fine , because that meant he was n't bringing back his virginity either . Well , unless you count being molested by this casino . \n\nLet me start over . When I began writing this review , I was writing it for the Palms Place resort . I was only using my 6am-and-still-in-the-casino story to explain my exhaustion , and use it as a warning before transitioning into my review of our actual suite . However , as I continued to ramble , I realized that this has enough gems to be a review of its own . So let 's jump back in . \n\nWith dick and pockets both dry , P refused to walk away from the action . But unlike his hair , my boredom started to grow , and soon left me balls deep in a conversation with some random Israeli gentleman who started our conversation by asking me if I gamble . It must have been the way I said , \ `` `` `` `` Nope , never . Not at all , \ `` `` `` `` that convinced him I was interested in spending the next 30-minutes listening to him break down his formula for an 80 % winning-percentage in roulette . \n\nLike all roulette conversations , this one also was followed up by literally dozens of questions on everything from Foreign Policy to soccer . I was pumped . Luckily , I was saved by irony . About midway through my optimistic response to the problem with America 's public education system , I was interrupted by quite possibly the drunkest bitch I have ever seen . Clearly lacking intelligence , and a functioning metabolism , I could n't deny her originality . Instead of some corny and cliche pickup line , this barefoot bitch thought outside of the box , and just spilled her drink on me . Luckily , it was about 7am , so of course she was double-fisting , enabling my shirt to get shit-faced . Before she could say a word , I stood , shook my man 's hand , and announced that I had to go because I think my shirt had too much to drink and it needed to sober up . I think I confused her . Which made sense , because I do n't even think she knew that she was carrying two drinks , let alone spilling them . I like to think that she stuck around and finished answering my new Israeli friend 's question on education , which eventually led to her sitting on his trapper keeper ( if you know what I 'm saying ) , but who knows . Love is blind . As for me , I walked about twenty yards back to the table , just in time to see my buddy P go broke . It was perfect . ``",1,positive

32880,"This buffet is hit or miss and it figures that the time I decide to review it , the place had a very off day , including giving me a mild case of food poisoning again . Usually , the fried chicken , if available , is the top attraction , due to its crispyness and moist meat . On this day , which was a Monday afternoon , I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering . Nothing else actually looked or tasted good . Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough , that is why I purchased the buffet . Too bad , that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out . Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease . Mongolian BBQ was also tried , but they do n't put any sauce on it when they cook it , so it tastes just like , well nothing . The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and did n't taste much better either . Deserts needed some work as well , but the butter pecan custard ( they said it was ) was decent , although could have been the culprit also to my later problems . You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something ( like some corn , etc ) he is all over it , taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up . I 'm all for a clean buffet , but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon . Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat . Call ahead and if the fried chicken is available for dinner , it is worth the $ 8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch , which would include potatoes . Oh , the rice was excellent .",0,negative

Here is the story of my latest trip . \n\nWe will start with the decor . It was bland and boring and just rang of some gringo 's idea of what Mexico looks like based on a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon . Plus the tables are so small a party of four did n't have enough room for drinks and plates ; we had to hijack a nearby empty table because the plates were so huge . \n\nOn to the service now . One big note to good service : do n't be strung out when working . Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table . She took her merry time getting drinks ( 15 minutes for 2 drafts ) she checked in in us maybe once . The only upside was that the food came out quickly . \n\nThe downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag . I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings . Big mistake . I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six . The chicken was dry and tough . The tamale corn was soggy and gritty . The tortillas were crap . The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef . All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing . The rice was hard . The refried beans were processes and pur\u00e9ed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn . If they charged Taco Bell prices I would n't be as upset but this was n't cheap either . \n\nTo finish up Emiliano 's is a stain on the name of Mexico . They know most Americans would n't know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face . So they buy in a bunch of processed flavorless crap , microwave it , and send it out as \ `` `` `` `` authentic\ `` `` `` `` . This place is crap . Steer clear . ``",0,negative
25131,"I 've brought my truck here a couple of times , the last one was about 2 months ago and they sucked it up . It took forever to get it cleaned , almost an hour and half , and then I had to to make them go back over it to get all the spots they missed . \n\nThe part that made me decide not to go back there again though is , I have husky all weather floor mats and after taking them out to clean them , one of the workers put the floor mat back in over my gas pedal . When I started the car the engine hit it 's rev limiter . Also another thing I do n't like are the guy the great you are always trying to up sell you to the highest package .",0,negative

7753,"I traveled over to Circus Circus to meet up with a friend and checkout the casino . When I say traveled I mean traveled . We stayed at the Tropicana and even though we got on the tram train thing we still had to walk , walk and walk some more before arriving at the Big Top . It looks pretty cool enough on the outside , I mean you have the shiny lights and the Vegas fixings . \nWhen you walk through the doors things change up a bit . I felt like I had walked into an indoor fair grounds . There were kids everywhere . I guess they are the product of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . \nWe watched one on the Circus acts . The act had a bunch of very bendable men pouncing around in leopard print costumes . The act was really good . That was really about all I liked about the Big Top . \nA visit to Circus Circus was enough for me . I do n't think I would want to actually stay . It 's so far from all the fun things in Las Vegas .

11069,"We will not be coming back here . \n\nWe were given a Groupon 20 for 40 from a friend & thought we would try it . The menu online looked interesting . So we made reservations . When we got there there are no instructions that guests with reservations do n't have to wait in the line . Oh we 'll no biggie . \n\nWell we were seated and pretty much ignored us for 15 minutes . We ordered drinks finally & that was the last time we were provided anything to drink . At the 30 minute mark we got the appetizers . The lukewarm lobster bisque had no lobster at all & 2 ravioli at the bottom of a fairly large bowl . The ceasar salad was one half of a heart of romaine lettuce cut all the way down the middle including the core ( yuck ) . We had to cut that off & then cut up the 'salad ' to make it eatable . 45-55 minutes into the meal we get the veal we ordered as the main entree & unfortunately it had an odd taste to it so I could n't finish mine . The waiter took another 10-15 minutes to even ask how the meal was ( mind you we have n't had anything to drink in a while either ) and he gave me just enough time to nod but little else . 10 more minutes he comes flying by us and we asked for the tab but he did n't acknowledge us . However 8 more minutes & he came with the tab & mentioned our Groupon discount dropped off the box . We packed up like lightening and left a pathetic tip for pathetic service . I felt bad because I know how much the tips mean but I hardly saw this guy . The service was way too long , no refills on our drinks , and even the GM looked right at us as we were getting more & more frustrated with the service and never once came over . I can honestly see no reason to go back to this place as the service was 1 star , the quality was 2 stars and nothing on the menu seemed really stand out ( that you could n't get a more excellent option elsewhere ) .",0,negative

37444,"I stopped in here a while ago to quickly obtain a hair product . I was in a rush and put on a wig before I went there . While I was being rung up , one of the female workers there was asking me about what was going on underneath my wig . I quickly got embarrassed and wanted to leave immediately . I was not having a great hair day but I certainly did n't expect for someone working there to be do nosy and ask me about things that do n't concern them . I understand that it 's a beauty supply but if I 'm going there for a certain item , I do n't need their workers to question me or comment on my appearance unless they are giving compliments . The person was n't being rude but I was n't there for my wig . I did n't ask them for any assistance regarding that . I simply wanted to get my product and leave . I purchased my item and have n't been back since and I wo n't ever go back because I felt offended and embarrassed .

6245,"One star because I ca n't give zero . Or maybe a star for the server - after her initial bitchiness i got the feeling that she felt sorry for my hungry ass . Why ? Because it took about an hour for me to get my food - and when it came it was n't worth the wait . Here 's the deal - I walked in alone and asked to be seated outside . The restaurant was crowded and the music really loud . When I sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order ( hot green tea ) and brought it over pretty quickly . I had already decided what to have - I 'm a creature of habit when it comes to sushi , so I placed the order , sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book . About 15 minutes later , the server comes over to say that the sushi bar is slammed and that it will take 30 more minutes for my food to prepared . When I communicated to her that I was n't really happy about this , she told me that she 'd understand if I left . But where am I going ? By the time I get up and walk over to another restaurant , wait for a table and be served , it would take longer so I decide to stay . What a mistake . After half an hour comes and goes , I turn around to look inside and THERES NOBODY SITTING AT THE SUSHI BAR ! ! ! I was pissed ! Why am I waiting ? ? ? Apparently there were two large tables that ordered a lot of food , but WTF ? ? ? I 'm one person who only ordered a few pieces of sushi for gods sake . I finally say to the girl - hey - can they at least send me a portion of my order ? ? ? So she comes back with half the order and about 10 minutes later the rest . I take a bite and am gobsmacked to find the rice practically crunchy . It was actually hard . So I picked away most of the rice , ate the fish and asked for the check . A manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit . Did she not notice that I was drinking tea ? I told her that I do n't live in the area and asked that she take something off the bill - which she did . But nothing would inspire me to go to this restaurant again . I mean , really - it 's a large place that seats tons of people . You 'd think that they 'd be prepared to feed the amount of people who occupy the place in a somewhat timely manner . While it was crowded , it was n't like there was a wait out the door and every seat filled . Talk about poor management . Find your sushi elsewhere in Scottsdale !",0,negative

4740,"After being given a couple of recommendations from people and co-workers I finnally decided to give The Sub Station a try . I decided to try their steak and cheese . Being able to get whatever add-ons I wanted without extra cost is great , the fact that I did n't get much or that they were n't evenly distributed was n't so much . I decided on a nice bowl of soup to go with the sandwich , watery cheddar and stiff broccoli . Which had to be microwaved before served.\n\nAnd that was only my first experience.\n\nThinking it may have just been a bad day , or I made the wrong choice in sandwhich ( which shouldnt happen in the first place ) I chose a chicken sandwhich . Again , getting tons of add-ons the only consistent one was the slices of tomato and lettuce , I was lucky enough to count three pieces of chopped onion and there was No oil and vinegar . So I had to ask for some ranch , which was pitifully bland.\n\nI could be just catching them on a bad day , but if everytime I go there is a bad day for them . Maybe I 'll just stay away so they can have good ones from now on . \n\n3X3 Analysis : \n\nPros : \n- Nice amount of seating which is not intrusive to the order line or drink station.\n- Decent wait time.\n- Free refills ( though I 'm not sure if they were free or they just do n't care ) .\n\nCons : \n ( I 'll have to narrow this down as I am only putting the top three in ) \n- Bored or uninterested staff , it seems they 'd much rather be somewhere else or doing anything but making food.\n- Disinterested for the care of the sandwich , not one of the sandwiches I got were well built.\n- Almost total lack of condiments , your only choice besides oil and vinegar is Sarachi sauce . \n\nFinal Decision : \nI doubt I will be returning there by choice . If I absolutely have to I may just ask for some chips and a large soda . Maybe a pack or two of crackers . So long as its nothing they actually make .",0,negative

24737,"Recently some of my colleagues from Spain were visiting and on their last night in town , I offered to take them to dinner . They immediately told me that they NEEDED to have authentic Mexican food and they really wanted tacos . After searching through pages and pages of Yelp and Google , and polling my friends on facebook ... I finally chose La Condesa over many strong recommendations of Los Dos Molinos , Barrio Cafe , Aunt Chiladas , and many more ... . Now , I realized that never having been there myself before I was taking a bit of a risk ... but my fellow Yelpers surely could n't lead me astray , right ? ! \n\nHappily , they did not ! The food was delicious . The four of us all ordered different kinds of tacos and we all loved our dishes ! I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco , which I DEFINITELY recommend ! The flavor was amazing ! a little heat , a little citrusy ... .mmm mmm mmm ! ! Two of my co-workers had the Carne Asada and they both raved about it the whole way home . we all shared an Horchata for dessert -- wow ! very good too ! It 's a big drink , so I do recommend sharing - it 's totally worth it ! Their bellies were content before the long flight back to Espana ! \n\nThe portions were good . Not too big , not too small . Two tacos were filling - I always like to know what to expect . Nobody had any leftovers , so I think the portions were just right . \n\nOf course , the salsa bar is a key feature of this place . I think we only made it through 5 or 6 kinds and I liked them all . The mango one was one of my favorites , which is a surprise b/c I 'm not usually a huge fan , but I loved the sweet and spicy combo - it was done just right . \n\nI 've already sent the link to my foodie brother in law - the whole fam will be visiting for the holidays , we will definitely be going back ! This will be a MUST visit place for my future recommendations ! \n\nYeah !",1,positive

Dr. Rueckl is one of just a couple of experts who do this type of surgery here in Vegas.\n\nI was very appreciative of his wonderful bedside manner , and found him completely honest : since the lesion was on my leg , he advised against having it and suggested I have it removed in the traditional manner . He said if it were he , he would n't do it ! But after thoroughly explaining the pros and cons , he ultimately left it up to me . I decided to go with it , for reasons irrelevant to this review . He said the procedure would be practically painless , and it was . \n\nAt both the initial consultation and at surgery ( in-office ) , I did n't have to wait very long before I was seen .

15956,"I went here yesterday for a spring training game between the Cubs and Doggers . In addition to my previous review I have few more issues with this stadium.\n\nThis was a major event . A sellout . This sort of thing only happens a handful of times a year at cashman . There was absolutely nobody directing traffic . Nobody at the 95 and Vegas blvd . Nobody at Vegas blvd and Bonanza . Nobody at Vegas blvd and Washington . I do n't expect to not wait in traffic . But I do expect a minimum amount of event planning when this event has been held for countless years and I pay double the amount of what a spring training ticket should cost.\n\nIn addition to nobody directing traffic , there was also no security or no ushers once we arrived 30 minutes late . Security is needed because there are dogger fans . Everyone knows that dogger fans are classless and typically carry weapons . Nobody checked my bag when entering . I did n't pay ridiculous ticket prices just so I could be stabbed by a thug . \n\nUshers are needed because apparently people from Las Vegas have never attended a baseball game .

A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light , almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it . \n\nWas I supposed to put this on my eyes ? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.\n\nThat 's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $ 10 price tag and list of liquor . This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price . Granted , $ 10 is n't horrible , but what if I was watching my money ? When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip , be honest with me or I 'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.\n\nSo bottom line ...

4045,"Cox Communications is a dishonest , arrogant , self serving , expensive company that I tell everyone to avoid . They 're advertisements are pure lies as to what you get when purchasing a service . They 're price discounts last for only a short period of time and then you get hit with the full price which they hide and do n't disclose . They make you buy bundles of crap TV channels in order to get the few channels you want . They have recently improved their broadband internet speeds , because Centurylink is bringing in fiber 1 gig , but before that , you could n't get anywhere near the advertised speed . The only reason they 're still in business is because they bribe the local elected officials with massive campaign contributions to keep competition out , and advertise intensely , especially that they gave a pittance to a local charity . They block access to sites they do n't want you to go to because they 're not their business cronies , and they give preferential speed to their cronies , and lie about it to cover it up . Corrupt does n't even begin to describe it .",0,negative
21813,"Our flight arrived to Vegas earlier than excepted , so we expected our room not to be ready . When we arrived at the hotel on May 19th , the front desk girl offered us a room that was ready on the 28th floor that was n't facing the Bellagio fountain . I booked a corner view suite had requested a room on a high floor with a Bellagio fountain view when I first made the reservation . There are 56 floors at the hotel . She then said there was a room on the 30th floor with a view of the Bellagio fountain , but it was n't ready . She continued to look for rooms , which she then said that there was a room on the 50th room with a Bellagio fountain view , but it was n't ready yet either . We agreed to wait for that room to be cleaned , which she said it would be couple of hours before it would be ready . We waited a couple of hours by walking around the area before calling to check to see if the room was ready yet . I was transferred to housekeeping , who said it was n't ready yet and they would call me back when it was . After eating and walking around some more for a couple more hours without hearing back from anyone , we decided to go back to the hotel and was told that the room was ready . It would of been nice if they had called me as they told me they would\n\nUpon inspecting the room , we found a dirty fork and knife in the dishwasher , as well as trash in a trash can underneath the kitchen sink . When housekeeping called to see if the utensils were delivered , which I requested upon check-in and had been delivered , I told them about the trash and dirty utensils . They said they would send someone up to take care of it . No one ever showed up , so the trash and dirty utensils were left until the next day when housekeeping came to clean the room . The room did have a great view of the fountain , strip , and mountains ! ! ! \n\nOn the evening of Thursday May 20th , I called concierge to attempt to change reservation time for dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria . I held on the phone for 30 mins waiting for someone to answer , but no one ever did , so I hung up and decided to call the restaurant directly myself . \n\nThe hotel is a nice hotel , which unlike some other reviewers , I feel that it IS within a short walk to the Bellagio , Aria , The Cosmopolitan , and the strip . I would suggest going to the 24hr CVS , which is a short walk and is located a block south of CityCenter on the strip to grab snacks and drinks , since the market inside the hotel has limited choices and closes at a certain time.\n\nThe Clark County fire station is located adjacent to the property . They tend to stay busy , which on one of the late nights/early morning hours , they seemed to respond to several calls in a span of 4 to 5 hours . The windows are not sound proof , so you will hear the sirens , which may interrupt your sleep if you 're a light sleeper.\n\nThe entire property is nice , which I would stay there again , especially with it being a non-smoking/non-gaming hotel .",1,positive

It was LOTS , just leaving me just enough room for a cup of help-yourself Spicy Beef Soup , my favorite of theirs , to which I added some brown rice.\n\nAs a big eater I go for the Large Bowl ( $ 9.93* ) .

I explained to her that I called the wrong place but that I was there now and how could we rectify the situation . She said the only way to have rectified it was if I were to come back as soon as I realized I had the wrong salad . Totally convenient right ? ! \n\nI know it is not a huge difference , but the Greek Salad is about $ 5.00 and the Gryo $ 10.00 . \n\nI was very nice to her the whole time and she kept raising her voice at me in front of customers .

The host joked around about me being late ( which I appreciated ) , but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk ! The person who escorted us to our table was warm , welcoming , and hilarious to talk to ! \n\nWhen making our reservation , we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come , first-serve ( about a 90 minute wait at that time ) . However , we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating . We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait ( nor the drunks roaming the Strip ) . \n\nAs for the food , I had the filet mignon merlot , as well as escargot , saut\u00e9ed mushrooms , and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc . The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS ! One of the best filets I 've ever had and reasonably priced . It was so tender and flavorful , and I loved the merlot sauce ! It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory . Additionally , the frites were delicious ( albeit salty ) , especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce . I would not recommend the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms , and the escargot was just mediocre . I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot , but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out . \n\nThe service at Mon Ami Gabi was great ! Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked . However , they were also efficient and accurate , which is equally important . The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top ! The restaurant was not too noisy , especially compared to Sugar Factory . \n\nIf you are looking for a high-quality restaurant ( especially a steakhouse ) with a view of the Bellagio fountains , but can not afford Bellagio 's high-end restaurants , Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place !

After that , everything else is what I consider the personal taste part . The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .

Literally . From soup to nuts , as my mom would say ( though ... wtf ? ? ) . \n\nThe registry service is good - I phoned up to get all of the \ `` `` `` `` boring paperwork\ `` `` `` `` as the girl called it , out of the way . A few days later I got a ton of ( free ) inserts to give people to tell them where we 're registered and what the registry number is . They give you the option of allowing people to donate to charity , which is great , as well as the option to buy gift certificates , and even pay into the honeymoon provided it 's booked by a certain company . \n\nThe best part of it all ( according to The Man ) is the voucher for two free coffees/teas and two pastries while you shop . The sugar and caffeine was definitely needed.\n\nWe arrived at the store reasonably early on a Saturday morning , knowing that the place would become pretty hellish by mid-day . We got all of the relevant instruction , was told which departments could provide us with additional advice regarding table ware , got our little scanner , and headed on our way . \n\nThe scanner was a borderline nightmare , not all items could be scanned and had to be keyed in , and not all codes keyed in properly . Some of the items which should have scanned , did n't , and some items did n't seem to have any scan/code reference at all . Basically , you just have to go in store to really *see* the things you 're registering for , but then you need to polish everything up ( and add and subtract items ) at home , online . I have no idea how people did it before the internet , it would have been even more of a nightmare . \n\nIt 's not John Lewis ' fault , though . They provided the best service they could , but it was just a bit unfortunate that the fun wedding registry afternoon I 'd imagined ended with both of us shattered , with something like a dozen items on the list . ``",1,positive
23454,"`` Let me get this straight , I am a fair minded and reasonable adult , I do n't go out of my way to purposely slam and talk down about a business unless they REALLY have it coming . 24 Hour Fitness had it coming.\n\nLong story short , I was a member at this Chandler location for a year and a half , and when I chose to cancel out of personal reasons and my displeasure with the club I went through the regular cancellation process . This process means walking in , sitting down , telling them you 're done , and they release you and cancel your membership right ? I thought so too . So there I am 4 months later really digging into the bank account that this membership was on , looking at my activity , and I have been charged every month since November . How can this be when I cancelled in person and had a staff member cancel my membership ? \n\nAfter getting corporate on the phone , they tell me that not only am I STILL A MEMBER , they have no record of me cancelling or even making contact about it . I tell them my story and give them a very deserving earful . Finally , this call center worker tells me \ `` `` `` `` okay , we can get that cancelled right now and refund that money\ `` `` `` `` , you bet you will refund that money ! You will do it right now ! $ 120 stolen from me over 4 months ... And why ? Because some employee working there , some front end sales guy , never actually cancelled my membership when I was sitting down with him asking to cancel it . He was smiling in my face as he lied to me about the membership being cancelled . Oh yeah , I 'm sure he just \ `` `` `` `` forgot\ `` `` `` `` to press a few buttons or sign a few forms . They know what they are doing , they will do anything to steal from you and find a loophole , hoping you 're too stupid and blind to ever notice .

Work out at home , at the park , or at some tiny mom and pop business , these giant gym chains are thieves , plain and simple.\n\nLet me also mention this , last summer in 2012 the A/C broke in this gym , and it was n't fixed ... not once . They gave all the club members a bunch of heave-ho about \ `` `` `` `` oh , we 're fixing it , we 're working on it.\ `` `` `` `` The A/C stayed broken all the way through November when I cancelled . The gym smelled like a bag of dirty socks and it was at least 90 degrees in there , talk about a bad environment to work out in.\n\nThis place is a disaster zone , I urge anyone who wants to keep their money to stay away .

Highlight was the wings , which were NOT fried ... tender , not oversauced , generally above-average.\n\nThe ribs ( both baby back and St. Louis ) were mediocre at best . WAY over-smoked , sort of overcooked . My husband said they tasted like kielbasa . I do n't think anyone at the table disagreed . The funny thing is , you get your choice of sides ... My husband and I got steamed veggies ( you have to save calories somewhere ) , and , it turns out , the portions of the \ `` `` `` `` good-for-you\ `` `` `` `` stuff are like half of the other stuff ( creamed corn , mac and cheese , baked beans , fries ) .\n\nThis place is a definite \ `` `` `` `` not recommend\ `` `` `` `` . ``",0,negative

The indifferent man behind the desk was indifferently indifferent as to the whereabouts of said SUV . It took him a good 10 minutes to master the computer and locate it at the Encore lot .

5011,"Let 's go to the movies ! When all other theaters in town are sold out , come here and you 'll have elbow room to spare . \n\nIt has been a while since my last visit ... like most people with a new car , park far away from everyone to save the new and shiny as long as possible ... just to find a ding in the side when I returned from the show . Anyway , took my chances and came back to see a newly released matinee . I tried Phillips Place and Epicentre before coming here and both shows and future showings were sold out . However , AMC was n't and had plenty of seating to spare . Like others have noted , if you do n't want a crowded theater with 22 screens you are bound to find a show and still keep your personal space.\n\nThe concession stand was great and speedy . The popcorn was delicious ... although now you serve up your own butter . Obviously , I need to get to the movies more often . \n\nMy one issue is if you buy your tickets online and pay the extra fee , you should n't have to wait in the ticket line to get a physical ticket ( really defeats the convenience ) . Hopefully theaters and Fandango can work that out . \n\nOverall , I 'm very happy with AMC on South Boulevard .",1,positive

Unfortunately , the service was extremely slow , taking 35 minutes to get our food . On top of this , the waitress did not come one time to check on us . When we asked about getting our fries , they informed us that it was up to us to ask them to bring it out before our burgers if we wanted the fries first ( even though they automatically brought us our fries first on our last visit ) .\n\nWe ordered the peking duck steamed buns , which were very good , but not as good as burgers . We also ordered the sliders , to which they forgot to add the fried eggs we had wanted . The waitress gave us a % 10 discount for all these mistakes and the slowness of the service , but I left feeling very dissatisfied.\n\nI can understand the wait if the restaurant was packed , but almost 40 minutes for food when the restaurant is less than half full is incomprehensible to me , especially when the waitress does n't even come to check on you .",0,negative

21553,"After watching Kick ass at the near by Harkins , my buddy and I decided to walk down the street and grab a bite to eat . I was being treated for my birthday ( it was actually on Thursday the 22nd ) so I was hoping for a good time . Last time we split a Chicago pan pizza which was really huge and good . The greeter took us right to our table near the bar and in perfect view of the start of the Laker game . \n\nOur server was a great help in narrowing down our choices as we both wanted to try something new besides the pizza . I ordered the chicken parm and he had the cheese tortellini . Both came out after about 20 minutes which seemed longer given that I had missed breakfast but was worth it when I saw the food . Nice looking chicken breaded and baked till crispy not soggy . They also did not skip on the cheese which was a great thing in my book as I am a big cheese freak LOL.\n\nEverything was great until I tasted the pasta sauce . Instead of mumm , it was more like What the hell is this ! All I can say is yuck ! The sauce tasted like a can of tomato sauce , mixed with one of those season packets from a pack of chicken flavored top ramen . Now I do not like to send my food back ( seen to many of those caught on camera specials on fox I guess ) but I had to this time . I asked the waitress if this is the main sauce they use for all their dishes and she said yes except for the pizza . Thank goodness for that was my thought . \n\nThat left me with very limited choices so I decided to just finish my meal with a order of mozzarella sticks . The chicken parm was removed and was taken off our bill which was great but left me with the birthday blues . After about the second cheese stick I was ready to go . My buddy was buzzing like a happy little bee after the two beers and a double shot of Irish whiskey he had so we paid the check and left.\n\nNow I know this place does one thing and does it really well and that is Pizza . As long as that is what your order then you are golden , but try to stray into the path of the unknown and you to will be sorry .",0,negative

26933,"My daughter 's cheer team stayed here for one night because that was about all we could take . Our girls are 6 , 7 and 8 years old . There were all kinds of creepy people hanging out around the hotel along with a package of sex toys that one of our coaches happen to get a photo of . One of our dad 's was approached by one of the bartenders letting him know if he needed sexual services that he would be sure to get it there at Rumor . My cheer team was promised we could practice in the courtyard , but there was dog poop all over the place so that was n't possible . Our cheer practice ended up being moved to an inside room , but the ceilings were short so we were unable to do our stunts . One of our moms had absolutely no hot water in her room to take a shower . the room I had was very dusty , missing a living room lamp , the sofa had black stains on it and had no throw pillows on the beds . The room literally had to be cleaned while we were in it . \n\nOverall it was HOTEL HELL . Nice try , but I can never do it again .",0,negative
19999,First off I 'd like to say I 've read a lot of the reviews for this place especially the newer reviews so I knew what we were getting into . With that being said I was still hoping to walk out and not feel guilty for blowing 50 bucks on dinner . Ofcourse it didnt work out that way . I still feel bad the next day . The only thing that saves me from getting really pissed was that we got to see the mermaid swim around in the huge aquarium in the casino area . She put on a great show so it was worth it in that respect.\n I gave the place a star because at least the drink lady was nice to us . She seemed to be the only one actually working . The other buffet staff were just rude . I could even hear them complaining because we asked for a booth . That really pissed me off ! I got a players card before we went to the buffet to get a slight discount . We still ended up paying $ 13.99 per adult . The kicker is they charged my 8 year old son adult price ! I almost lost it . He hardly eats anything ... well not like an adult anyway . They did charge my daughter half price because shes 6 years old . I assume she 'll be an adult when she hits 7 ... lol . What a joke.\n So the food flat out sucks . Most of the food tastes microwaved and even some stuff feels like its from the day before . Their wonton with crab was hard as a rock . I did like their bbq ribs . That was about the only thing that was decent . The guy cutting the rib roast was just hilarious . The first time I went to get a slice he gave me a paper thin slice . It was so tiny I thought he was joking but then he walked away ... So I went back later to get another slice and I told him to give me a thick slice . Son of a b*tch gave me the same sized slice . So I asked for another slice . Bastard gives me another thin slice then he walks away . I was wondering if I was on some kind 've hidden camera show or something . But after talking it over with my wife we came to the conclusion that they probably are told to only give small slices out because the one roast they have probably has to last the whole night . Just lame ! So this place is n't worth it . For the same money other casinos have way better buffets and the quality is so much higher .,0,negative

We sat at the bar , which is purely lit with candles . The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout .

252,"I 'm from California and hotcakes is something that 's not common in our food vocabulary . We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela 's for brunch and it was pretty packed . Fortunately , it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us . I glanced through the menu and learned that they 're known for their specialty hotcakes . They all looked very good , but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes ( was craving strawberries ) . We finally got seated , ordered what we want , and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner . The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes . They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can ! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part . A bit heavy on the butter , but that 's how you get the crispiness . The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries , as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element . As for the brown sugar , that was like the cherry on top . It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you 're in Pittsburgh !",1,positive

28204,"This place is near my job . It is one of the few restaurants that I can eat at in the area , between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance . I have eaten here over a dozen times . I agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced , but I have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up . \n\nHOWEVER , twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up . The first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it . She gave me a strange look when I asked for another napkin . Once she realized it she did apologize . The second time she spilled someone else 's ice on my feet and purse . I got a muttered apology with no eye contact . I waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business . I am a regular and it was the second spill . No one approached me so I left . \n\nI do believe that the young woman is a nice person . She seemed embarrassed , but the staff have poor customer service skills.\n\nAlso , I believe that they substitute greens without informing the customer . Once I ordered romaine and believe I got iceberg . Same thing when I ordered butter lettuce . If you want real greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.\n\nI admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in South Phoenix . I wish this place was managed better ...",0,negative
31538,"I have came here a few times and I think it 's time to have an overall opinion of this place.\n\nFood 4 stars\nThey just made some changes to the menu , which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint . Their wings are among my favorites ( if not THE favorite ) . They are big and meaty and grilled . And even better , 6 for $ 5 ( or 50 cents each on late night bar menu ) . Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best . The chili is different ; it was made with chunk of meats ... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night . The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed : open mouth , pop one in . They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer . And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies . And they are good ... Honey butter makes it even better . \nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint . While I was never a big fan of macs , I am pleased by this place . Their smoked chicken is moist ( I had dark meat ) . Brisket is a thick slice type . My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table . Some side items are lacking in the wow factor , but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese ( and onion rings were a little bland too ) . I do LOVE the corn , which tastes even better the next day . \n\nService 3 stars\nWhile I never had bad services here , I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm . On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order , which I think for a newer joint like this , a convincing ( and honest ) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way . Same with beer suggestion . People , this place has a beer selection ! Again , the bartender has always been ok , but an extra wow factor can make a difference . \n\nLocation/Atmosphere 3.5 stars\nThis used to be levacchia . Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much . Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be . It is huge frankly . It is right next to the light rail stop . They validate parking which is great for arena events . \n\nA little disclaimer : I met the owners , who invited a few people to taste the new menu . Is my review skewed because of it . Never . But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything . And it makes me want to see this place strives . I mean , they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on , with volume ! \n\nCome and try them out.\nBudget conscious alert : 3 words . LATE NIGHT MENU . 2 more words . DRINK SPECIALS . After 9 or 9:30pm . I know y'all are not in bed yet . Oh wait , 2 more words . FREE PARKING !",1,positive
32268,"IHOP is n't bad , it 's just not that good either . I used to think IHOP was much better several years ago . They still have good pancakes and French toast , but unfortunately I do n't think they do well with most other dishes especially outside of breakfast . The sausage seems like it was not cooked , but more like boiled or something . Hashbrowns were also pretty good I guess , but generally I can get just as good or better at several other resturants . Just seems like the overall quality of the food and service just is n't what it used to be . I would actually rather go to even Denny 's these days , whereas a few years ago I would have chosen IHOP first . They seemed to remove several items off the menu that I loved . This time around I did n't see any types of skillets on the menu which is dissapointing for me because that is one of my favorite breakfast options . The quality of the food is down , and the price of the food is a bit high considering the lower quality . Also just want to add a comment about the service . We were seated in a corner and none of the servers noticed us for nearly 10 minutes . Not exactly the best service , they should be able to do much better .",0,negative

It 's buried in the WAY back part of Mandalay Bay where the convention center is . Walk past Fluer , Light , Starbucks , etc ... When you think you 've walked too far , you 'll find it : - ) \n\nThey are opening a new location located directly on the strip at Ceasars and this one will stay open . They have indoor and outside seating . The outside overlooks the lazy river . \n\nThe only negative ( for me ) is I 've noticed the vegetarian and vegan options disappearing from the menu . Meat is being added ( almost unnecessarily ) to items . If you do n't care , this wo n't matter . For me it does . \n\nI 'll be back for sure . I hope they adjust the menu trend so I can come back many more too ! \n\nAlso , if you sign up to their email club online , you will get a buy 1 get 1 entree free for use within the next ? 30-60 days ( do n't quote me on the length ) \n\nPlease thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit .

4,"Even when we did n't have a car Filene 's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront . I always find something ( usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $ 60 ) and better still , I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later . \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh ; it 's much better than the usual department stores , better than Marshall 's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown , even when it has a sale . Selection , bargains AND quality.\n\nI like this Filene 's better than Gabriel Brothers , which are harder to get to . Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper 's challenge and I 'm afraid I did n't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . .

20935,"Great little spot in Phoenix ! My boyfriend and I came here after work one day for a few cocktails and some food . They had an amazing special that was $ 39 for a four-course-meal for two . Everything we had was so delicious ! Neither of us could stop eating the jalape\u00f1o cheese curds nor the macaroni and cheese ; both were very cheesy , heavy , and just the right portion . The filet mignon was tender and the cut was a little thinner than it 's supposed to be , but still very good for the price . For dessert , we had their cheesecake , also delicious . They seem to change up their menu frequently so the dessert items are often different . The cocktails there were also fantastic . I 'm a huge lover of a well-mixed drink with balanced flavors , and this place had it all . The negroni was right on par with what it should taste like , and their whiskey sours were nothing like either of us had ever had . I would definitely recommend the whiskey sour to anyone that goes there , because it is a must-try ! All in all , nice , quaint atmosphere with a very interesting arrangement of furniture that resembles a living room in one part , great food , and excellent service .",1,positive

7880,"`` This happened on the morning of September 25th , 2011 around 2am . If you want to be handcuffed , thrown against the wall and the floor behind closed doors and then thrown on the street ... then this is the place for you . The gangster Vegas is still alive my friends , it has n't changed , well at least at the Wynn ... maybe they were going for that throwback feel . Here 's my story : I contact a promoter by the name of Luis Deleon , super nice guy by the way , he gets my friend and I a table right next to the DJ booth ( table 708 or 780 ) in Tryst at the Wynn . Things are going great we got in right away . Before going in I stop for a second to say hi to the doorman , Ryan , I met him the other day when I went to the sane club 2 nights previous , he was also a nice guy but that 's where the niceness stops . So I 'm at my table now , I spend 600 dollars on a bottle of vodka and my friend I are having a good time..DJ spider is up on stage doing his thing , working the crowd and mixing an amazing run of tracks ! ! My friend and I invite this couple up ( Andrew and Jessica ) to help us drink all this vodka , we start talking cars and nightlife in Vegas just normal stuff and then we realize ... there 's no more vodka ! ! ! Let 's buy a bottle of Rum , so I drop another 600 dollars on that . The bottle comes and we start drinking and dancing some more . I 'm now successfully drunk and getting tired..but the nice thing is that I have a table..my own little area so I sit down and fall asleep , now usually sleeping in a club is a no no , but I have a table and my own area , I should be able to close my eyes for a second , I mean by this time it 's only 1:30 in the morning and the club stays open till 5 . I still have a good three hours to party . So , I 'm awoken by 2 security guards that tell me I have to leave , I say , \ `` `` `` `` no , I paid a lot of money to sit here and plus I just but this basically full bottle of Rum\ `` `` `` `` . They picked me up forcefully and started pushing me out , I 'm resisting a bit but what they did next was way out of line ! They handcuffed me , took me to some long hallway where there was no one , pushed me on the ground and against the wall and basically manhandled me , I said , \ `` `` `` `` you guys want to beat me up while I 'm handcuffed ? Take them off and let 's do this ! Let 's make this a fair fight , so first I 'm gon na beat you up ( I point at one of the 3 security guards there..the one that was the most forceful and aggressive with me ) then you , and you over there..I guess you 'll end up in the ICU ! \ `` `` `` `` now on retrospect I know I should n't of said that but I was drunk and just got beat up by three guys in an unfair fight . The first guy I pointed at said , \ `` `` `` `` how about I put you on the VIP list at Drais and I 'll meet you there when I get off\ `` `` `` `` ... \ `` `` `` `` Sounds good to me ! ! \ `` `` `` `` he took out his phone and put me on there and said..\ `` `` `` `` see you there\ `` `` `` `` they then took me to some door , to off the handcuffs and pushed me out on to the sidewalk . So to sum up things , they basically kicked me out of the club but decided to beat me up first . Thanks tryst ! In the morning I woke up with bumps all over my head from where it hit the wall and ground , a black eye , a big bruise on my face , and handcuff bruises because they were on so tight . Basically I would n't recommend this place ``",0,negative

Although you can pay for whatever you wan na get at the food court at the front registers is a little better , that still is kind of a hassle.\n\nIn the end , I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here .

They seemed pretty oblivious to this though and just kept wandering by . I really do n't mind since they 're really just showing off all they had to offer and there was a pretty good variety but everything was so ridiculously dry . \n\nBite after bite of beyond-well-done meats were piled onto our plates and something within the first ten bites made my stomach churn . \ `` `` `` `` Where 's the bathroom ? \ `` `` `` `` I had asked politely to a snooty waitress . \ `` `` `` `` We have none here .

10865,"This review is in reference to the venue and not the restaurant.\n\nMy wife and I recently attended the Anthrax show on January 22nd 2012 . The tickets were $ 29 50 each plus a $ 10.00 convenience from Ticketmaster for this general admission show . \n\nThis was my first HOB show but I do know they have some seating and tables which we were hoping to arrive in time to get one since our old bones just ca n't withstand the brutality of the pit like we did in the old days . Anyway , come to find out all of the surrounding tables were reserved only . $ 200.00 for the table that included a bottle of Sky Vodka and only ( 4 ) metal heads per table . Really ... $ 200 table at a Anthrax show ? Ok , fine if you think that is worth it . \n\nNow here comes the main reason for my review . The upper seating deck was available but closed off . We were told that it would open soon when the floor got packed . After the first act finished sure enough it opened up but there was a charge . What ? ? ? $ 10.00 more per person to sit in the upper deck seating . Come on HOB ! We already paid to be in the venue and hardly anybody went upstairs . As if you were n't making enough money on the bar you had to stick it to me one more time . My complaint is if your going to charge extra for seating then do it in the advertisement for the show . I 'll pay for it . Do n't call it general admission then charge extra to sit down in the venue.\n\nIn the end I guess I should be grateful I was n't charged $ 5.00 for leaning on the wall .",0,negative

608,"The Bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18 . It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison , south of the airport . Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands , while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue . It is an fairly easy course to walk , except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes . The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course , but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition . I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you , but there always seems to be a bit of both . Other courses are either too hard or too easy ( mostly too hard ) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible . It 's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you , and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area . \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport . Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets , and this is distracting at first . Once you 've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts , and Dane County Regional is n't exactly O'Hare . Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy . The vegetation in the O.B . areas is thick reedy wetland stuff , so just go ahead and consider that ball lost . Lastly , the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow . However , since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor . For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker , but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $ 22 to $ 37 walking 18 depending on the time . There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $ 10 . The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow . The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses . The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps . The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug . You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well . The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made . The wraps are a satisfying end to the round , as are the sandwiches and the appetizers . You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse , which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating . Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too . I think that top to bottom , the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite .",1,positive

They had a lot of people at the bar even though it was a Wed night and the place was fairly busy . Husband got a cheeseburger and fries , that was really GOOD ! They cooked it medium but just barely as they knew he liked it medium rare . The kids meal was a great deal , macaroni and cheese with a side of baked potato . My kids were able to split it so it was perfect ! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken flat bread . It was sort of like a pizza with balsamic marinated chicken , olives , onions , and feta . My only criticism is it really needed some mozzarella and just a hint of feta . Instead it had no mozzarella at all and the only cheese on it was feta . TONS of feta . I scraped most of it off and left it on my plate . Do n't get me wrong it was still delicious , but with no melt-able cheese to hold everything together it was a little hard to eat and everything kept falling off . And that much feta is just too strong . But I ate it all and left only the excess feta on the plate . So there ! ha ha . Also my food came out wrong the first time and had to be remade . It would have been nice if someone told the manager . he popped by our table to see if we were \ `` `` `` `` all right\ `` `` `` `` and I was sitting there with no food .

35174,"I have had Bella Fresco on my bookmarks for a while and finally decided to stop in tonight to try falafel and gelato ( not together ) for the first time tonight.\n\nLocated at the back of the Arboretum ( past Chili 's and right next to Qdoba ) . Big , lovely signage let me know I was in the right place . The parking lot at the Arbo sucks - the lines are n't clearly marked anymore , pot holes , speed bumps , oddly configured , etc . , but there is plenty of parking.\n\nI was instantly greeted upon walking in by who I am guessing is an owner . He told me to pick a table and left me with a menu as my waitress was already walking up to take my drink order . Shortly after I placed my order.\n\nThe food : \nFalafel ( $ 5 ) - I have never had falafel before , but from what I have read , this was exactly it . 6 balls , about the size of golf balls , of deep fried chick pea mash with spices and I believe I saw onions . It was quite spicy , but the thick tzatziki that they served with it was cooling and amazing . I would n't order it that way again , but it was tasty enough . \nPhilosophy pita ( $ 6 ) - Lettuce , Philly steak grilled with green peppers , mushrooms , onions , provolone and mayo . I guess Showmar 's has led me astray as to what a pita is , because this order was more like a wrap ( thinner than a pita , thicker and sturdier than a tortilla ) . It was served more like a wrap , but I did very much enjoy it . There was a lot of lettuce ( not a complaint ) and the warm flavors in the wrap were good . I ordered the potato salad with this and it was a yellow potato salad , so I was expecting a mustard taste , but it was sweet and very mild . About the consistency of grocery store potato salad , but good . \n\nMy waitress was super friendly and pretty efficient considering she was the only waitress waiting on everyone ( most tables were families with kids ) .\n\nOn to the highlight of the evening - the gelato ... holy smokes . Creamy , yummy goodness . The owner ( extremely helpful , very personable ) was manning the gelato bar when I was trying to decide and he volunteered NUMEROUS sample spoons of different flavors - hazelnut , salted caramel , pistachio , birthday cake , chocolate , I think one was called Turkish Delight , coconut , vanilla , I think there was a mocha or cappuccino - SO many flavors , it was incredible really - and each taste was just as delicious or more delicious than the one before . I finally decided on a small cup ( $ 3.84 ) of the biscotti flavor and it was heavenly . A small cup was plenty too - it was so rich . I was excited to see they had a Sugar Free Chocolate , so I will be hauling the parents over to try that after some lunch.\n\nThe meal was good , everything on the menu seemed to be very fair/reasonably priced as far as the food goes and I will definitely be back for more .",1,positive

Originally planned to go to Mac 's this past Friday ( Jun 24 ) with 5 out-of-town buddies plus 2 others , and got talked into changing to Midwood Smokehouse ( same buddy as above ) . \n\nWhile their menu states they may run out of bbq from time to time ( never seen a restaurant advertise running out of food before , but whatever ) , they were out of pulled pork bbq on Friday night at 8:00 , and also out of bacon wrapped jalepenos ( got ta love the south , they wrap everything in bacon ) .\n\nI ordered a rack of ribs to compare to Mac 's and they tasted like they were cooked in the oven as they had zero smoke flavor . The bbq sauce did n't help at all , too bland . The waiter hooked us up with wings since they were out of pork bbq and the wings were supposedly smoked but had zero flavor . No rub , no sauce , no nothin . The mac & cheese however was very good ( close to Mac 's ) .\n\nI tried my buddy 's sausage and it was dry and tasted like cardboard . Midwood Smokehouse has been open for only 2 months , hopefully they step up their game !",0,negative

Good thing I do n't wear makeup because you could n't see anything in the bathroom . Could barely see the soap I showered with .

1736,"I mainly fly out of Terminal 2 and 4 ( guess my alliance ... ha ! ) , so that 's what all my opinions are based on.\n\nTerminal 4 is larger/newer and now has the SkyTrain from the economy parking to it , which is surprisingly more convenient than I though , so maybe it 's not a complete waste of money . Although , you still need to take shuttles to the rest of the terminals.\nThe signage is rather clear for the most part , but if you are part of any of the premium boarding groups , sometimes the signs are either not very clear or missing . Seems to have gotten better lately though . Baggage claim area has large screens telling you which carousel has your flight 's luggage ( foreshadowing for Terminal 2 right here ) . If you are being picked up by someone , remember that there is both a North and a South side of the arrivals area , so be clear where you are going to be right away , besides just naming the door number.\n\nTerminal 2 should just be a regional airport of its own . It sure got the conveniences of one . The signage for initial security check point is Flight Crews , First class and the rest . Do note , First Class is actually for most Premier flyers and TSA PreCheck as well . Not that anyone can tell you that.\nThe 4 baggage claims carousels ( in theory ) show the flight number of where the luggage is coming from , but so far it at best displays late , or more often is announced over the speaker and for most fun occasions , on the wrong carousel altogether . At the very least , there is only one side to the terminal , so you do n't have to tell North/South to your heat stricken friends when they pick you up.\n\nFood/entertainment choices are nothing exception in either of the terminals and are typical airport food .",1,positive

Okay now I am intrigued and stay with me people ! \nI nervously waited in the endless line which included some weirdos who were not in the line just standing by it to confuse everyone . I was still questioning this crazy concoction , but as an adventurous eater I had to try it . When we FINALLY got to the front I ordered . They did not have gouda , but no matter I order swiss instead . They were also out of most of the types of hot dogs , but luckily I just wanted a regular anyway . Then you stand in a line to wait for your food . This was lots of time to second guess my sanity on this one , but I am glad I did not.\nThe hot dog was REAL GOOD ! i took it over to where the band was playing ( Blueshounds were also a really good addition to my hot dog experience ) . WOWZA ! This thing was good ! The dog was served up in naan bread instead of the usual bun . The salty sweet and spicy combo was unlike anything I have ever tasted and good too !

27746,"I do n't normally do this , but I finally stopped being sick after eating here last night . \n\nI 'd like to preface this by saying this is not a service review . The service was not the problem , although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars , I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead . $ 5 would have been reasonable.\n\nThe real problem what what I ate . We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine . As a Canadian , when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it . It was a long way from the delicious , savory poutine from my homeland . For those of you who have never eaten poutine , it would fit right in with southern style cooking . Take french fries , add creamy cheese curds ( or if you 're not sure where to buy those , chopped up braided mozzarella works well too ) , top with fresh , steamy brown gravy . The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.\n\nThis was not what I experienced . First of all , the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried ( another special appetizer they had ) . Instead of the poutine effect of creamy , melty , cheesy goodness , it was more like soggy clumps . I made due , it 's been a while since I 've had poutine . I asked for no pico de gailo , because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine . I did n't get any as part of the order , so once again , i praise the server for taking a proper order . There was enough gravy , but there was just something ... off about it . It was very subtle , but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette , but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals . \n\nThe abdominal pain started at 2 am , about 4 hours after consuming the meal . I 'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting ... usually . I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed . Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room , I will say that finally , at 12 pm today , I stopped feeling sick.\n\nNow I do n't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy ( leaning towards the gravy ) , but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen . If you 're going to be serving food to people , what 's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management . You need to have standards . Taste your food . Keep it consistent . \n\nThis is the only location that I 've ever had such an experience . I hope this criticism serves as constructive , to prevent others from getting sick from the food . Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients !",0,negative

21668,"Ok , maybe I was hungry and swayed by the easy parking , great modern design , nice outdoor eating space , friendly staff and good food . But , who would n't give this a 5 . What a great way to have a breakfast spot . Walk up to the counter , order , get your own coffee , drinks , condiments , etc , and choose your seat . If your coffee gets low , you just get it . Need more water ? It 's all right there . How many times at a regular restaurant have you said that you wished you could just refill your own drink yourself , because you would not have to wait ? Probably many times or you just got upset . Here you go . \n\nThis place has great modern decor with nice colors and accents . I noticed it right away when we walked in . Not what you would expect from the outside , a pleasant surprise . \n\nThere are menus on the wall and menus up above and printed menus if you want something you can hold to read and choose your fare . We opted for a veggie scramble with zucchini , yellow squash , and hold the onions for me , a Santa Fe Benedict ( thanks to all the fantastic yelp reviews ) and two coffees . We signed up for a frequent visitor card and even got an extra 10 % off . Woohoo , always welcomed . It came to just $ 20 for the two of us.\n\nWe chose our seats , near a power outlet so that I could charge my phone , and got comfortable . I made a trip to the restroom to find a very upscale modern bathroom that I was quite impressed by . Not necessarily fitting of a breakfast spot , but totally appropriate with all the other modern decor . \n\nOur breakfast seemed to take a little while , but looked great when it arrived . The quantity of food seemed pretty good for the price and everything looked and tasted very fresh . I was very pleased with my choice of veggie scramble and thoroughly enjoyed it . SG loved his benedict and I even got to sample it . Not being a poached egg fan , I was skeptical , but I got very little yolk in my taste . The sauce was delicious , I definitely understand all the yelp . Both of us enjoyed our coffees and had no problem getting up to refill . Especially since we do not really like our coffees refilled mid cup , it just messes up the chemistry.\n\nThis place is a little tucked away from the freeway and not super convenient to drive to when you are just in town visiting , but its only just under 10 minutes detour for a fantastic breakfast . Well worth it . We will likely be back .",1,positive
33505,"This is a new Chandler steakhouse restaurant down in the Ocotillo area , owned by the same owners of the Living Room and Sushi room next door..Just opened 2 weeks ago so we were excited to see what they were bringing new to the area , plus the reviews have been mixed . \nWe went early on a weekday for appetizers and wine to avoid any dinner rush . The atmosphere is really nice here , very intimate , not loud like the sister restaurant ( Living Room ) ..We sat at the bar , the 2 bartenders ( Julie and Jazzlyn ) were extremely nice and efficient . Wine list is good , not great but what was really good here were the appetizers . We had the grilled artichoke and smoked salmon and both of these were large portions and very good . This was enough for us as a dinner . \nWe left by 6pm or so and by that time more people were filtering in for dinner and bar . We had a very good experience here and will definitely be back given that there are very few higher end restaurants in the south Chandler area , but it 's great to see new places opening .",1,positive
4152,"`` Here is a summary of what we experienced with Heliocol : \n-Jan 2013- Phone quote- $ 840 to move panels + $ 5/ft for new piping ( ? length ) . Heliocol came for site survey Jan 23 , but we never received a written quote for total length and price.\n-April 9 appt was rescheduled to April 10\n-April 10- No-show ( I waited at home for 4 hours ) \n-New appt for April 19 made . In the meantime , Holly , a manager , confirmed pricing of $ 5/ft for stronger piping ( SCH80 ) to replace 2.5 yr-old piping ( SCH40 ) that melted from the heat generated by system ( NOT under warranty anymore ) . That they would install piping unable to withstand normal system working conditions speaks poorly about the company ! \n-April 19- Wrong team arrived in AM . I waited all day for the installation team to come . System was moved to new location , but piping was not connected.\n-April 26- Installation team arrived to finish job , but gave price of $ 13/ft for SCH80 pipes- total price for the job was now $ 2500 ! No work done due to pricing disagreement.\n-Week of April 29- after much discussion , Heliocol gave a final \ `` `` `` `` discounted\ `` `` `` `` price of $ 1485 . This \ `` `` `` `` discounted\ `` `` `` `` price was given due to the company 's inability to give a consistent quote , not to mention \ `` `` `` `` no quote\ `` `` `` `` received in January after a site survey . We did appreciate the lower price given to us.\n-Due to this week-long delay to establish pricing , the next available appt was now May 28 . That is over one month later- with loss of use of pool solar heating , not to mention lost wages from taking time off to be available for them all these times.\n-May 28- No-show ( we waited 3 hours at home ) . Frustrated , we called and asked if they could come on May 29 or May 30 , since we would be able to supervise the work . They refused , and instead , scheduled us for May 31 when no one was home . We also asked about some compensation for all this extra time . We were told to draft an email and they would speak with the owner to \ `` `` `` `` see what we can do.\ `` `` `` `` We received no response from them over a 48 hour period despite 2 emails.\n-May 31 appt- work was finally completed . Since we were not home to supervise , we have no way of knowing whether the SCH80 piping was in fact used at all . \n\nHeliocol feels that as customers , our time is not valuable ( our installation job was cancelled/no-showed over a 51-day period willy-nilly ) . Thirty-two days after the day they were supposed to finish the job was the first available appointment they could give us even though we had suffered so many setbacks due to their poor service . One would hope that our less-than-stellar experience would encourage them to expedite our job , but that was not their plan . In fact , they delayed us yet again on May 28 by no-showing . We then begged them to come in the next 2 days since we would be home , but they refused to move their schedule on our behalf . It was as if they felt entitled to postpone us because they were collecting $ 1000 less than originally intended . \n\nThe email we were encouraged to send the director was met with no response after 48 hours , so I sent him another email on May 30 . His response to me on May 31 was \ `` `` `` `` I did not respond to your email because I was responding to your BBB complaint.\ `` `` `` `` He was too busy to respond to his customer ! Ironically , they wasted no time calling us to collect payment . We received several voicemails asking us to pay for the installation around noon on May 31 , before we were even home to ascertain that the job was completed ! ``",0,negative

The cheese breadstick were just ok. \n The minus 3 stars was for the service/employees working there when we went in . They were arguing with one another , the delivery driver walked in and he was definitely stoned .

They give you a little salsa on your plate and charge you for tiny pre-filled cups if you want any extra . The woman behind the counter was utterly unfriendly and did nothing but jabber in Spanish with the cook , caring nothing about whether I was happy with my food or needed anything else . This place does NOT qualify as a restaurant , Mexican or otherwise . \n\nThe lack of authentic non-chain Mexican food in Arizona , particularly Tempe , is shameful , tragic and pathetic . What disappoints all newcomers to Arizona is finding out that the state 's proximity to Mexico and its large Mexican-American population has NOT resulted in it being a place where one can find great Mexican food . ``",0,negative

We did n't have silverware and when my wife asked , the waiter asked if a plastic fork was ok. She had a salad and wings . I looked up and asked U Wot M8 ? \ `` `` `` `` Are you serious ? \ `` `` `` `` He just stared at me and said he would go get one but they were dirty . I said we do n't want a dirty fork and he just left . He came back with not one , but three sets of perfectly good silverware wrapped in napkins and they were clean . Needless to say , the waiter was dreadful and I had a hard time tipping him anything but I mustered a small one.\n\nThe second night we came back and the place was dead , maybe at 20 % capacity but the lounge seemed busy ( on the other side ) .

She was not attentive to our drinks and , again , I had a hard time justifying a tip.\n\nBottom-line : Go for the food because it IS good but do n't expect anything beyond that .

My wife would certainly disagree - she had the \ `` `` `` `` Senorita Roll\ `` `` `` `` on her mind for many days after we went there , and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.\n\n4.25 star dishes and appetizers : The spicy riblets are INSANE . One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle ... but it works ! And I think that is what is special about Moto ... the menu has a nice dash of daring , unconventional twists on what could have been ( and often is ) just very ordinary fare at other places . \n\nPS - the portion sizes of some dishes ( like yakisoba ) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here , so if you attend with a group , do n't be afraid to \ `` `` `` `` underorder\ `` `` `` `` a bit and to share it family-style . ``",1,positive
33520,"While the food was good , the service was AWFUL . The restaurant was well-staffed and not overly busy , so we could not figure out why our waitress was so slow . We politely voiced our disappointment with the manager , and she was very apologetic , going to far as to buy us a round of drinks , although we told her that was not necessary . One would think that after lodging a complaint that the service would have improved , but no such luck . Based on our experience , it would seem that the owners went well out of their way to hire the most inefficient , apathetic , unpleasant people they could find . While this place has potential , without a major personnel change , I predict that they will be hurting for business before long . We will not be returning .",0,negative

30585,"It 's such a convenience to have two solid microbreweries located side by side , especially when they are both good ! After grabbing a cold one at NoDa we walked like fifty feet to Birdsong to check out what they had . I had n't had the opportunity to have one of their beers before , but after grabbing a beer here I was a fan.\n\nBirdsong is a bit of the opposite of NoDa in terms of environment , with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller , tighter indoor area and bar . They were offering about eight beers or so and they all sounded pretty good . They had some live music kicking on the patio and the peanut cans were overflowing with salty goodness . When I drink I like to have a little something to munch on , and free peanuts fulfilled this need perfectly.\n\nIt is pretty darn awesome to have Birdsong and NoDa located so close together . Both produce very good beer and offer laid back , comfortable areas to enjoy said booze in . Birdsong is definitely worth the visit ... I just wish I could find their brews at local restaurants more often !",1,positive

36949,"`` The absolute worst hotel experience I 've had in my life ! Really there is so much to complain about I could write a book . Where to begin ? Well , checking in at 11pm on Thursday night was going to take 3-4 hours , so I did n't even get to see my room until 4:30 in the morning . I refused to just stand in the humungous line of over 300 people , so instead I went sight seeing with friends who were staying at a normal hotel across the street . Guess this is what I get for being cheap ! Although the rooms were really inexpensive , I would have paid to leave this place . \n\nMy other big complaint was their parking garage . It is a giant nonsensical mess of pillars , with no signs directing which way to go . Cars weave every which way , some going the wrong way and almost causing head on collisions . It took me almost half an hour just to cross Las Vegas Blvd to get to the garage portion . Then I had to follow a huge maze , dodging pillars and pedestrians , before finally finding parking . \n\nOnce I FINALLY got to my room at 4am , I found that it was decent . It was up on a higher level with a partial strip view , and I think the carpeting was new . The bed was very comfortable , and the room had a small balcony . They upgraded me to this \ `` `` `` `` VIP\ `` `` `` `` room after losing my original reservation . Thank god , because if this was for VIPs , I ca n't even imagine what a regular room would 've looked like ! It was very basic , but at least clean . That 's more than I can say for the rest of this casino . \n\nAt the lobby , gift shop areas , and check in desk , the carpeting was absolutely filthy . The entire property stunk of rancid cigarette smoke , as did the clientele . Everyone walking around in the place looked like bums or out of work hookers . There were a few average joes like me roaming around , who looked absolutely horrified at their surroundings . \n\nChecking out was another fiasco . Their easy checkout on the TV was n't working , and the phone system to reach someone at the front desk takes about as long as checking in , so I finally resorted to waiting in line downstairs . This hotel equaled a whole lot of stinky waiting to go nowhere . I would n't recommend it to anyone , unless you are flat broke and ca n't afford anything else .

Since this was the first time I did n't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas , I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve . Matt and I need plans ! Therefore , after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve , I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday . Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations . In the end , this place did not disappoint ! ! I will unquestionably be back . \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that was n't too sweet . I do n't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect , and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started . \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special . It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky ( and insanely buttery ) rosemary mashed potatoes . How would I describe the entire meal ? In one word , perfection ! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate . You ca n't really go wrong with asparagus but this was n't just your regular vegetable . They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty . And yeah , the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them ... but that 's the best way to make em ! \n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant . The atmosphere is n't too lively but it is n't too dull . Tons of families , friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic . I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas , and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday . They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience . \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour ... so once I get the chance , I 'm going to head right back here and try it out !

32700,"My boyfriend and I visited this day spa yesterday after purchasing a Groupon . The interior is nicely designed with light music and had that signature lavender smell of a spa . Check-in was easy and we filled out all the normal paperwork . The woman at the front counter was busy answering the phones , making several Groupon appointments , but we were n't offered any water or the typical , 'Your massage therapist will be right with you ' once we turned in the paperwork .

There was a counter in the back and a small bench to place your clothes in the corner . The music continued to play in the room on the overhead speakers throughout the massage . It would have been nice to see a little more decoration in the room to make it feel more inviting . I 'm not sure why these places do n't invest a little more into decorations and give it a true spa feel . Additionally , the music overhead was okay but it would be a nice touch to be offered a different music selection if possible . Granted , this is all wishful thinking and above and beyond what you typically see in a day spa but it would have put this place over the top because my massage was fantastic ! \n\nDominic asked if there way anything I needed extra attention on before starting and he did an excellent job of massaging just the right places . I 've had several massages before but I would say this is definitely one of my top .

The fresh-squeezed OJ and pineapple juice were really good too , but overpriced . Service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the food was a little slow coming out . The order were correct the first time , and the waitress checked up on us frequently . We had a little bit of sticker shock , but the food was good enough to bring us back Sunday for breakfast again . \n\nIn general , we like this place , and we will be back when we are downtown around breakfast time , but likely wo n't go out of the way to go here.\n\nPS : I know there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar , and we knew that before we went to TBC , so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar , but I kept an eye on it . The bar remained packed even when the restaurant was n't , and people seemed generally happy , so they may have fixed the bar service problem . I saw this on both days , so it was n't just a fluke .",1,positive
374,Fastest year of my life ! The growth panel is complete and we could n't be happier . The last session was the most fun . Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I did n't think we 'd get huge laughs and smiles . I was wrong . Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots . They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward . \n\nWhen I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place . Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play ... she did n't cry ( remember she 's been having separation anxiety ) . She actually had a fun time . They were really nice and patient with us .,1,positive
14763,"I love this place . I always thought that I would n't enjoy Greek food , so I tended avoided My Big Fat Greek . However after my cousin 's wedding we decided to go here for lunch.\n\nWe started off with a trio hummus appetizer , and it was delicious . It came with warm pita and a generous amount of each hummus dip . A word of caution though : The Garlic Hummus is very garlicky . We liked it , but I do n't think everyone is as insane as we are when it comes to our love of garlic . \n\nI got a chicken souvlaki with a Greek salad for my side , and it was amazing . Not to mention the meal kept me full all day . To end it we got an order of Baklava to share and I could 've eaten the whole plate . I have n't been able to go back since then , but needless to say I keep thinking about it haha . \n\nIt 's a must for those of you who like Greek food . For those who are unfamiliar with it , be prepared for the high amounts of garlic and onion in your food . It 's not so much that it 's bad , but if it 's not something you 're used to , you could be a little thrown off taste-wise . The lemon potatoes are as they say , lemony , so keep that in mind too . But please order the baklava . That is something you wo n't regret . \n\nI hope this review helps !",1,positive
9618,"`` I 've read about celebrities going to Nobu . My friend talked about Nobu like it was a god of sorts . When we found out we had a table waiting for us at Nobu , I was ready to go and feast myself on its delights . We ordered : The miso black cod , salmon nigiri , a soft shell crab roll , the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer , the mushroom salad , a vegetarian cut roll , and the tiradito . To drink I had the cucumber martini . It was seriously one of the best drinks I have ever had . It tasted like it was made with lychee vodka , and was smooth , refreshing and not too sweet . Unfortunately our positive experience ended there . After waiting an hour for our table , we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water . We sat at our table and for 9 people , 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored . I glanced at the menus , waited . Our waiter came by and I asked him for waters all around and food menus . 15 minutes go by . We had no water , and no menus . Finally , we 're given 5 menus for 9 people , as he handed me the last menu , he left saying \ `` `` `` `` We 're a little short on menus.\ `` `` `` `` We shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have . We asked him for some suggestions , and he pretty much just brushed us off . We finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos . Before I could order anything else , he rushes off . The next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos . Pretty much the whole night , he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result , we were unable to dine together . I can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll . The vegetable cut roll was pretty good , I mean , steamed vegetables , wrapped in a cucumber wrap , with a little ponzu sauce . The mushroom salad was pretty gross . The mushrooms were varied ; trumpets , oysters , shiitake , enoki . The sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad . Everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good , and they loved the miso black cod . Everything else , however , they said was mediocre . Mediocreness is ok , if it was n't coupled with poor service and a $ 400+ bill . When the bill came , we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar . His response ? \ `` `` `` `` No you did n't , but you can just take it out of my tip.\ `` `` `` `` I secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they do n't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in San Francisco for a quarter of the price . Overall verdict : Skip it . The atmosphere is not really that great , the food is n't really that great , and the service should not be called service . The Pros : The cucumber martini was super good . ``",0,negative
36883,Awful place . I canceled my membership and they continued to charge my account 94.00 dollars a month for 6 months ! ! When I finally brought this to their attention that I had not been to their salon for 6 months they refused to refund me my money . I basically paid 600 dollars when I did not tan at their location one time within 6 months . They told me all they could do for me was offer me 4 free months of tanning . I was extremely upset and frustrated by the way they would treat a customer . They robbed me of 600 dollars when I am a student and do not have that type of money to waste . Be aware when you cancel your membership that they are not secretly charging you ! !,0,negative
28638,"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the next big club in Vegas . From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club . I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant , you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club . The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is . Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor . A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they do n't let you sit for very long . They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs , it 's called the Boombox . A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor . If you go up one level from the main floor , you 're at the library . Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up , again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables . From that floor , there 's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything . There 's also an outside part to club by the pool ? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating . We did n't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it 's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I 'm giving it 4 stars is that there 's not that many places to sit on the main floor . And when it gets crowded , the walk ways are almost impossible to go through without squeezing past one another.\n\nOther than those , I 'll definitely be going back to this place when I get the chance especially to see Kaskade since he 's made his home here for the next year ! He 'll be there once every month !",1,positive
6237,"A friend and I visited Queen 's when we were in Scottsdale for a wedding in April . Being tourists , we relied on Yelp and a salesgirl at Nordstrom for a pre-wedding pedi recommendation close to our hotel . Queen 's was highly recommended , but after walking in , we were sadly disappointed . There was no A/C ( just a couple of fans and the doors propped open ) and the place seemed very outdated and run-down . The staff were super friendly , and I was very pleased with my pedicure , but my friend had a horrible experience ... \n\nThere were some major issues with her massage chair , and the staff kept switching her water from freezing cold to scalding hot with no warning . After doing that about four or five times ( and driving her close to madness ) , I noticed that the water hoses attached to the back of her chair were not connected properly ( or broken ) . Instead , there was a large bucket behind her chair catching all of the water that was running out ! Even better ? THERE WERE ELECTRICAL WIRES FROM THE MASSAGE CHAIR SITTING IN THE DIRTY STANDING WATER ! ! ! Hello ? My friend does not need a side of ELECTROCUTION with her sea salt scrub ! At one point the bucket was full so two staffers stopped what they were doing and went to work switching out the buckets ( about a 10 minute ordeal ) while my friend remained in her chair getting bumped and jostled all about . Not sure why no one thought to perhaps move her to a functioning pedi chair ... or at least temporarily move her while they performed maintenance , but needless to say , her experience was ruined.\n\nI 'd give Queen 's 1 Star for her misery , but I really did enjoy my pedi .

14736,"I recently moved here from CO . I was a member at the YMCA of Boulder Valley and was very happy . So , fast forward 5 months and I 'm looking for a gym . The Y was an obvious choice to check out . \n\nI took a tour at approx 10am on a Monday . The place was fairly busy , but not overcrowded . The staff were all friendly and the facility seemed great . The child watch area was great . The child watch staff were playing with the kids . This is what I expect at the Y . \n\nWhen it was time to talk about price , the outgoing and friendly tour guide got shy . I knew something bad was coming because the extroverted young lady seemed embarrassed . Well , now I know why . $ 70 a month for a single membership , plus $ 100 reg fee ! Even she was n't willing to turn that positive . She knew they had a great product , but was embarrassed that the Y charged so much . As a former member , she was going to try to snag me a better deal . However , I have n't heard back yet.\n\nYMCA staff , if you read this.. Understand that you have the most expensive gym in the area . Even Lifetime Fitness mall and spa have lower rates . Come on ! Golds Gym is a great facility ( less amenities , I know ) right down the street , I could buy 7 basic memberships there for what you are charging .

Sorry , that was a tangent . \n\nWe posted up at the bar and watched as a live band prepared to set up while we chatted with our bartender Dan and amongst ourselves , after having come downstairs from ooh-ing and ahh-ing at the gorgeous rooftop patio . I got the Little Hot Mess which was made with muddled strawberry - pretty much summer in a glass , and what 's not to love about that ? \n\nUpstairs was laid back and casual with strung lights - great for groups , while the main bar area below had a speakeasy feel with a vintage-y looking menu inviting guests to peruse a large selection of well-designed libations , with specials for Wednesday nights only . \n\nThe only thing I was bummed about was that I had n't visited this place sooner ! : )",1,positive
30982,"If I could choose no stars or negative stars I would . \n\nI purchased there Groupon deal to try this place because my friend recommended them saying they were great and since I have 2 dogs it was a good deal . Well I made an appointment for Sunday they call at 915am on Sunday when my appointment was 10am saying their groomer called in , which was inconvenient but was rescheduled for Monday at 9 so it was okay . When I called to make the appointment I talked to the guy for about 10min about my dogs , gave him their breed , age , said they were n't spayed or neutered & also were n't other dog friendly . He said he would try it out to see how she acted around the other dogs & if it did n't work he would just be put her in a kennel after grooming until I picked her up . I show up at 9am Monday morning drove 25min from my house to get there & when I arrive its a woman working who asks a few questions and I tell her everything I did to the guy while making the appointment . She then has another guy come out to say they have no kennels ( which I made an appointment ) so I should come first or at least have been told to schedule for another time . But then starts saying since she 's not fixed she ca n't be there anyway and then goes into talking about her temperament . Then asked if I was going to breed her & it would be in my best interest to breed her soon & get her fixed because she will cause problems in the future . Which thanks for the advice but if you ca n't groom my dogs which is the service I came for why are you lecturing me about my pets & I 've had my share of animals I do n't need your input on MY pets . Very unprofessional and should really get all their staff on the same page . Even if my dogs were spayed/neutered I would never take them there after that interaction or recommend them to anyone .",0,negative

5751,"I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night . Yep , I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit . We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus . Most of the folks there had been there several times before . Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ( $ 18.95 ) with salad and garlic knots . I know it 's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings . Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer . Then the pizzas came , then the wings followed by my pasta . Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last . The side salad was n't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread . The pasta was delicious . I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings . Both were really good , the pizza was a thin crisp in spots crust . The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings . I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me . After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of . If you followed along , you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.\n\nFor a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late . I just had the one beer ( 25oz ) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception ( weak ) all were done well.\n\nThis is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas . The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts . There is a good sized outdoor area too .",1,positive

I knew I was going to run into some sexual , raunchy and of course half naked bodies running around on stage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but I 'll leave that to your imagination . \n\nMMMmm ... .\n\nIt was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because we 'd have a better view then the front rows , plus it was less expensive so why not ? The intro was unlike no other Cirque show I 've seen . The host was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidating questions about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humorous . All the dancers were talented and I enjoyed all the acts , throughout the show I 've seen all types of body types on stage , full figure woman half naked , tall and small people and very attractive men and woman . I think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body . I enjoyed every second of this show and still have some of the acts in my memory . \n\nThis truly was a sensual experience ! ``",1,positive

28372,"Just had a very horrible experience here with placing a delivery order here . Called in to place my order with an Ashley , she asks for my number which I give her two times to confirm and tell her to have the driver call me so I can come down stairs and open the door due to no doorbell at my location I was at . She tells me no problem I will have the driver call . Remind you I am ordering for 6 hungry men that have had a long day to begin with . So one hour goes by and I call to get an ETA on the order and Ashley tells me the driver had been to my location and he was knocking and calling but I must have been to busy to hear my phone or door knocks . I said that 's weird I did not miss a call nor am I to busy right now so she said she will call the driver and have him come right back . I then asked her to make sure for the third time she had the right number and confirmed it again with her . I waited another 15 mins and nothing , so I call back a third time , and get a different employee . I tell her what happened and she places me on hold and puts me on with a manager , he tells me the same thing Ashley told me about the driver knocking and calling multiple times and he should be there any second . 10 mins later the driver shows up with me waiting outside at this point so I do n't miss him and as soon as he pulls up I say I 'm so sorry I did n't hear you knock , then the driver tells me he NEVER knocked he called the number printed on the ticket , I ask him what number it was , and it was a wrong number they printed . So my problem here is the simple fact two people lied to me and told me the driver knocked on my door , and they were confirming my number which they had the right one which they did n't . I am very upset that I was lied to and will never go here again as I go into the restaurant all the time . You just lost my business as well as the 6 other guys I was ordering for .

1188,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC . I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix : ) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family . The owner , Richard , is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc ! Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited . I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy ! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all . The food here is AMAZING ! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share . They have been on the TV show Diner , Drive-ins and Dives , which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there . I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta , which offers 4 choices of toppings . For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri , which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood . If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you ! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice . To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli , which is always made fresh and oh so yummy !",1,positive

They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives . \n\nWhile the prices are fantastic , it is always difficult to find what you are looking for , because they keep changing where everything is located . \n\nAlso when it finally comes time to check out , you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes , even if you only have one item.\n\nOverall , it could be a lot better .

36589,"They were n't friendly and almost everything I tried to order had some rule that prevented me from getting the quantity I preferred . Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city ( Kansas City brisket , Memphis pulled pork , St.louis ribs , etc . ) so the place really did n't have it 's own identity . The sides looked good but really lacked flavor . For example , the potato salad looked fabulous but really did n't taste like anything ; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess . The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat . I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything ( NOT a good sign ) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl . The brisket was thin and chewy , basically no smoked flavor . It also had cracks in it , so I guess they do n't cut to order ( either that are they are really doing something wrong ) . The ribs looked promising , but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor . The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate ( pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side , not BBQ sauce on top ) . Honestly , I did n't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away .",0,negative

21755,"First ( and lasting ) imression : Aria is the euro/clubby version of the other casinos.\n\nThe interior was not designed in traditional casino-form . It looks much different than the other casinos on the strip in that it has much more a trendy/nightclub feel . Even the Encore at the Wynn , a new hotel , still looks like an upscale casino , but Aria reminded me of a string of nightclubs and trendy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating . The lighting is much darker than the other hotels , but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables . \n\nThe spa is gorgeous , but again , there were n't people utilizing the facility there , rather just walking through viewing- it is very well-decorated like some yoga retreat center . The restaurants looked uninviting to families ( dark , trendy , and each with a unique colored-glow ) but probably appealing to a younger , single crowd . Busiest areas in the hotel were the casino , the under 18-arcade , and the food-court-style dining options , as would be expected given the time of year and economic climate .",0,negative

The decor basically screams \ `` `` `` `` Austin Powers ! \ `` `` `` `` redux , the Beatles are my favorite band , and the entrance which is basically a wall spelling out \ `` `` `` `` REVOLUTION\ `` `` `` `` that you enter through the spaces between the letters is really cool . Unfortunately the music here is at best hit and miss : There 's really nothing to set it apart from any other club/lounge when they spin the same techno/house as every other place on the Strip and if you ca n't do that any better ( and actually a lot worse ) than you competitors then you should at least commit to the Beatles theme fully and play some of their classics . The bartenders all look like they 're miserable behind the bar but at least the waitresses serving the tables try to look like they do n't hate being there . The drinks are rather standard price for a lounge ( 13-14 for a scotch ) and the table service is really cheap but this is n't the type of place you would want to spend too much time . Promoters in the Mirage give out all sorts of promotions : guys can usually get free entry before 11/12 and girls get open bar for a few hours , but as you 'd expect it 's all well drinks . The crowd is mainly 30 somethings and no one is particularly well dressed but you 'll probably run into a few conventioneers rocking the 3 piece suit and standing uncomfortably by the bar . \n\nOn the plus side , they usually have the Go-Go dancers who are n't dancing at the moment handing out free shots on the dance-floor .

27053,"`` I came to Commonplace because I love lavender , to the point that whenever I go to a new place I search \ `` `` `` `` lavender\ `` `` `` `` on yelp and go to any place that comes up . In this case , it was the lavender vanilla latte , and it was on point . I 've had a few disappointing experiences with lavender lattes , but my theory is that lavender with something else ( so lavender vanilla , lavender white mocha ) makes for an awesome latte . Their lavender vanilla syrup was homemade , according to the very friendly guy at the counter , and it is delicious . This wo n't change your mind about lavender if you do n't like it to begin with , but it may change your mind about lavender coffee . For $ 3.50 , or $ 4 for a large iced , the latte seemed a little steep for Pittsburgh , but then I came back to New York and remembered the true meaning of steep.\n\nSpeaking of New York , growing up there left me very tolerant of sharing cramped benches with strangers , but the communal wooden bench they have against the east wall is one of the most uncomfortable seating arrangements I 've ever experienced . It 's a little rickety , and what that meant for me was that I could feel the guy next to me wiggling his ass for several minutes at a time . I do n't know why he was doing this , but bottom line is I SHOULD N'T KNOW THAT HE WAS DOING IT . If you want to dance to the music in your head or do kegels at a coffee shop that 's your business . Nobody else should be able to feel it , but with this bench everyone could feel when I so much as scratched my leg . Other than that bench , the space was fine -- a little generic looking , but spacious and open.\n\nOne other bizarre thing about this place is that they have little card holders saying things like \ `` `` `` `` Table share , go ! \ `` `` `` `` for people to put at their tables . The idea makes sense , but it 's just sort of sad to think that people ca n't even be bothered to talk to each other about sharing a table .

11309,"`` I was satisfied coming here when it was 50 % locals . For around $ 17 , this buffet was good . BUT , for full price of a 25 % discount for most locals , it 's not worth it at all . \n\nThe front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into . There 's electronic pay machines one one side , and a small booth for the human counterparts . The problem here is when you want to get a discount , which you can get $ 1 off with their member card , you have to line up in the human one , and that one is LONG at times.\n\nService is pretty lazy , and the layout of the buffet seating is pretty odd in places . Booths can feel broken at times , and chairs are uncomfortable . Drinks are drinks , but the alcohol service is pay by drink ( others like Studio B are complimentary ) . \n\nThis buffet is large , but most of it is made up of \ `` `` `` `` make your own\ `` `` `` `` stations that suck .

Salad and soups are standard fare , asian sections sit around for a while ( cheap sushi sits out , and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while ) . Crab legs ( though I hate them ) were rather thin , but people still flock to them . What I find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was great -- fried perfectly , and the deserts were pretty good ( aside from the random one that looks great , but tastes horrid and is hard to eat ) . \n\nIf you 're a visitor , go somewhere else.\nIf you 're a local without their \ `` `` `` `` platinum\ `` `` `` `` membership , go somewhere else.\nIf you have that platinum membership card , think about going . ``",0,negative

We had the short ribs appetizer and that was really , really good . My husband had the prime rib sandwich and the truffle gorgonzola fries . He really liked it . Our daughter ordered a salad with salmon and she could n't finish it . The service at the time of the day during which we went was very good . The downside is its cold in the bar.\n\nI can see that things might get dicey when things get busy .",1,positive
20484,"`` Why did I wait so long to stop by Laurel Market ? Who knows , because this place is fantastic ! \n\nConveniently located off of South Blvd . , Laurel Market 's menu is chock full of sandwiches of all types - for breakfast , lunch , veg heads , meat lovers , etc . Make sure you pay attention to their deli hours ( 7 am-3 pm , Mon-Sat ) so you do n't miss out on a delish breakfast burrito or deli sandwich . And , as others have noted , there are only a few tables out front to hang out and eat - so do n't be surprised if you have to take your goods to go . \n\nI tried the CAST sandwich - freshly sliced turkey , green apple , cheddar , honey mustard & lettuce stuffed between two slices of sourdough ( my choice of bread ) . It was super tasty , full of sinus-clearing honey mustard and plenty of sandwich . With a bag of chips , a can of rootbeer , my big lunch amounted to $ 9.90 . Suffice it to say , I made a meal and a half out of it . \n\nWhile you 're there , check out the other goods - plenty of chips and accompaniments , massive \ `` `` `` `` Cowboy\ `` `` `` `` cookies , beverages , a smattering of wine and beer , and more . The staff here are extremely sweet and want to make sure you get exactly what you 're looking for . Plus - they offer catering ! \n\nI 'm absolutely looking forward to stopping by Laurel Market soon to try out more of their sandwich menu and perhaps score a famed breakfast burrito ! ``",1,positive

I had purchased two used tires from them in may 2013 and brought my vehicle back to them with the wheel shaking and they replaced one of the tires which had a bubble on it but not the other one . Well 11 days later the other tire deshreaded on the 60frwy and ripped off my front fender and bumper and tore apart the bottom of the drivers side door . When i made them aware of it and went to them to pay for repairs due to what their product ( tires ) did to my vehicle they refused .

12216,"We attended a wedding reception here in June , 2013 . I was going to let it slide , but I 've changed my mind . We were really looking forward to the dinner because we had had such positive experiences at the Sunday brunches with delicious food . Not so much at the wedding . No where to sit during the long ( over an hour ) cocktail hout . Servers would come out with maybe 10 appetizers on a tray and would be attacked by the first few peopole they passed . I actually only got two tiny appetizers the entire time . When we finally went into the room ( same room where the brunches are hel ) , we we very disappointed in the total LACK of decor . Absolutely nothing to indicate that there was anything speciazl - let alone a wedding - going on . No centerpeicesd - might have been the couple 's decision - I do n't know . Dinner was not served for almost 1 1/2 hours - we were one of the last tables to be served . My chicken was over-cooked ( actually hard on the edges - could n't cut ) and ice cold . A guest at our table had steak - and could n't chew it and it also was cold . The salads were so under-dressed that we questioned whether they had any dressing at all . It was a huge dissapointment . The groom was visably not happy . For what they paid per person , we shuld have had exceptonal food and service . Both were sorely lacking . Sure , it 's impressive to say you attended a receptiuon at Phipps , but the people who attended were extremely underwhelmed and definitely disappointed .

My friend had a steak ( smallish portion , cooked well . ) She was only passably impressed with the onion soup , though . \n\nAll in all , a very good dinner . Oddly enough though , despite the 4 stars , I do n't know that I would rush back . Though certainly , if I were in the area , I would be pleased to stop back in .",1,positive

5352,"On standby with nothing better to do but vent my frustrations about an airline that is completely incompetent ! \n\nTo start , my ticket did not have my TSA precheck on it ( despite having called and spoken to the us airways rep on the phone the day prior ) . My husband had his number , but not mine . So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of ... .doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check . \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed . I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely . I forgave and forgot . \n\nHOWEVER ... .for our 8:45 flight , we woke up early to be on time . It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel ( which , was awesome . Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio ) . Again , my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion , the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that . Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate . \n\nThen , waiting . And more waiting . For an 8:45 am flight , our odds were more promising . Not so . For some reason , the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave . Once boarded , another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight . Really ? An hour after the flight was to leave , the first flight of the day , and the bags just got on ? ! So that was why we were an hour late ? \n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late , we would miss our connecting . Not much she could do she said . Finally , we landed and ran to our gate ( mind you , we are with our six year old ) and get there on the nose . The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on . Perfect . \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby . We should have been home now . \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline . And guess what ? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways ! \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight , it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination . I may be back to edit this review ... \n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home ( finally ) , we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out . All clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned . Unbelievable .",0,negative

When it came time to purchase it , I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class . At this point , they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer ! ! ! ! Not to mention , I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer .

The apple/cheese was the best in flavor . The cucumber , which I expect to be light , was way too salty.\n\nScones : Our cranberry scones were good . My plain scone was overbaked . \n\nDessert : everything was meh . The macaron was so hard I could barely bite into it.\n\nTea : the tea was nothing to rave about . 12 standard tea flavors.\n\nAmbiance : we were really hoping to have a nice lunch out on the patio with our puppy . But the misters are broken ( the rest of the mall had their misters on and we enjoyed that ) , there are no fans . So it was way too hot to enjoy our hot tea.\n\nOverall not my favorite .

33620,"Was excited to check this place out since it seemed rather unique for the area , but the run of the mill food could not save the poor service . This place definitely reminds me of a person who thinks that they are wayyyyy hotter than they really are . \n\nFood was a 3 , service and overall experience was a 1 , so landed on a 2 rating . Would not recommend . Full review below - \n\nEarlier in the week , my wife called to ask a question about our reservation . She was promptly told we did n't have one ( we did ) and was hung up on . Delightful . Should have been red flag # # 1.\n\nWhen we walked in and the hostess seated our party ( spoiler - the reservation we actually had ) , the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the modified wine bottles that were used as drinking glasses.\n\nDrinks - Beer list was solid and definitely above average for the area . I settled on Dogfish 's Festina Peche which seemed refreshing given the recent heat/humidity combo . Going rate for the beer was $ 7 . When it came back from the bar , I noticed that I received it in a beer snifter glass which holds about 10oz . Looked around and noticed that other people in my party had the same pour . Now , I have no problem paying ( and have more than I should ) $ 7 , $ 10 , $ 12 for a 10oz pour of a higher alcohol by volume or rare seasonal beer . But $ 7 for a 10oz ( really 8oz since mine was short poured and spilled on the table ) fairly standard seasonal that has an ABV of 4.5 % ? The blatant money grab on the drinks is not a good look.\n\nFood - As happy hour was ending , I decided to order the Chef 's Charcuterie board . This was easily the best thing I had . Seemed like an assortment of pickled veggies and an egg with bread , jam and 3 kinds of meat . I ca n't tell you exactly what was on the board because the waiter just dropped it off in front of me with zero explanation and walked away . For the main course , there really was n't anything innovative or unique on the menu , so I settled on the pot roast because I was craving it for some reason . Tots were easily the best thing on the plate . Pot roast was kinda bland , definitely needed salt . Aioli did n't really add much and did n't really make all that much sense from a flavor profile in my opinion.\n\nA group of us ( 11 ) try a new place every month . This month happened to fall on a birthday . So , we brought some cupcakes as is the tradition . Waiter tells us that in order to serve them in the restaurant , we have to pay $ 4 a head . When we protest to the manager , he tells us it is a health code violation . So ... it 's a food safety risk unless we pay you $ 4 a head ? Word of advice , the money grab is bad for business . 11 people who had been there for 2 hours now will not order another $ 7-12 drink ( $ 77 is more than $ 44 , shocking I know ) and will leave with a bad feeling about your place . Not smart.\n\nOverall , food is ok , service is bad , drink situation will make you feel like you need a shower . Spend your time and money somewhere else and thank me later . Perhaps over a normal sized beer ?",0,negative

Thank you , yelpers , because we had a great lunch ! \n\nFirst and foremost , big portions are all fine and well , but I HATE getting a sandwich I ca n't get my mouth around , and that is as big as my head . These were good sized sandwiches , but manageable . The daughters split a pizza steak sandwich , something I have n't seen since I lived in St. Louis eons ago . If they 've been out here , I 've missed them . They devoured and raved . I had the mushroom Philly , and it was spot on . We all really liked the rolls ... not soft and squishy , but not so crisp that they rip up your mouth . Very good ! The fries were good ... perhaps on the skimpy side , portion wise . The beer batter onion rings were awesome , and huge on the portion size ... go figure . They have a full selection of Dr. Brown 's sodas , even the **shudder** Cel-Ray . ( never actually tried it ... s'pose I should give it a shot ) They have a shelf loaded with Tasty Cakes for you East Coasters , AND ... ..wait for it ... .

Everyone is here to have a good time . \n\nThe bar tables are ridiculous . The concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base , so you can not sit under the table at all . You have to sit sideways at the table . If I had waited an hour and a half to get that table , I would be pissed . Fortunately , we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats . Other than the grotesquely under-estimated wait time , the service was really good.\n\nThe tacos were interesting , but out of the four we tried I 'm not sure I would eat any of them again . For me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.\n\nThe cheese dip is not your standard Mexican fare . It has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get stringy and hard and cold.\n\nThe potato tostada was fantastic ! Served in a cold iron skillet , with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad , it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells . Separated by beans and crispy potato cubes , it has a great balance of flavor and texture . The green sauce on the table adds a lot to it . \n\nDefinitely a good addition to the restaurant/bar scene .",1,positive

My wife and I had been there twice before for dinner and really enjoyed it so we decided to come back on our anniversary and sit in the bar for the great live music . I realize we were sitting in the bar area , but the service this time was very slow and we were left alone for long spans . \n\nThe reason for my bad review : \nWe ordered a dish that contained mussels . Half way through eating it my wife realized one of the mussels was still closed . The waitress went to ask the chef about it and came back to tell us the chef said it happens all the time and its perfectly safe . We sent the dish away . Bye bye doggy bag . \nEven if the chef is right and the closed mussel is safe ... why would it be served that way ? There were only 3-4 mussels in the dish and it should be easy to check that they are all open.\nAnd also ... as a person with a phd in chemistry who now works in biochemistry ... I would not eat anything with a closed mussel in it . Its really not worth the risk . Also , the FDA tells us to throw out any mussels that do not open.\nJust to top off our bad experience we were charged for an extra bottle of wine and had to send the check back.\nI 'm really sad about the whole thing because we were really starting to like this place and would have gone back regularly . Instead we left feeling bad about it and a little nervous having also eaten oysters there that night ... .\nI should say that the other 2 times we were there the service was excellent and the food was really good .

I 'm not into men if that 's what you were thinking ( that 's what he said ) . Let me explain . Most malls are composed of 95 % womens products . This is no joke ! And the 5 % of stores that are not women 's I am counting the food court and gift shops that do n't even sell clothing . I admit malls are great for guys to go window shopping for eye candy ( go on ladies do your thang ) , but if you want some decent clothes there is no mens clothing ! This outlet actually has stores that men will shop at ! Also , unisex clothing stores have a men 's section and not just on rack hidden in the back of a women 's store . There 's nothing more embarrassing than wondering if something is your size and it turns out to be womens clothing . That 's a nightmare for a straight guy . \n\nVan Heusen , Nike , Reebok , Adidas , Nautica , Calvin Klein , Keith Cole , TIMBERLAND ! ! One of the last Timberland stores open .

If you just want to look around , still go ... but you should buy something because the prices are awesome . This is a must stop everytime you go to Las Vegas .

14816,"( Lyrics - Peter Cetera - Glory of Love ) \nToday it 's very clear , as we 're both eating here , \nthere 's so many things I want to try\nI will always review it , I will never leave you alone . \n\nSometimes I just forget , try things I might regret , \njust break the eggs and I 'll have it over easy . \nI do n't want to lose the yolk , \nI could never eat it alone\n\nI am a foodie who will try all your dishes , \nI can give you a review you 're dreaming of . \nWe 'll brunch forever , knowing together \nthat we ate it at the Morning Glory Cafe ! \n\nMorning Glory Cafe is one of the gems hidden in South Phoenix area . It 's literally a huge garden and picnic area . Perfect for a day outing with the family and friends . I usually go after a hike at South Mts . since its right down the street or around the area . Walking past the picnic area and organic gardens you would n't think you 're actually in Phoenix ; except if it 's super hot out ! \n\nBrunch ! My favorite meal of the day when I can get it ! This time around I ordered their Eggs Benedict , which they called the Morning Glory Benedict . Poached eggs , spinach , and ham on two muffins with hollandaise sauce ; seems pretty simple , but damn I love it ! Also free self serving lemonade and ice tea -- load up ! \n\nThere 's something about having brunch right outside over viewing the farm and picnic like scenery . It 's relaxing yet you feel connected with the natural setting . Someone pinch me ... ..Ouch ! Okay back to my office ... .sigh ! \n\nNeedless to say , Morning Glory Cafe , if I could sing like Peter Cetera that 's my anthem to you . The place is sweet and cute . No mimosas this time around , but look for me on the next round ! - Enjoy !",1,positive

Highly recommend .",1,positive
11153,"I ca n't say enough good things about the Wynn buffet . The food was amazing , the casino and the buffet are beautiful , and the service was excellent . After a ten dollar tip it ended up costing us about $ 40 per person for the whole thing , but it was well worth the price.\n\nThe thing that makes this buffet stand out in my eyes is their ability to work with people like us with food sensetivites and special dietary needs . I have n't bothered going to a buffet since I was diagnosed gluten ( celiac ) and dairy intolerant over two years ago . I am extremely sensetive to even the smallest amounts of gluten or dairy , so a buffet did n't seem like a good idea . After reading a few reviews on a few blogs my fiance and I decided to give it a shot , and boy are we glad we did ! ! The chef came out and gave us a tour of the whole buffet , showing us what was safe and what was not . They had a LOT of options for us including several deserts ( which pretty much never happens ) , all of which were delicious ! \n\nWe are already talking about our next trip to Vegas just so we can go to this buffet again ! !",1,positive

We saw the 2.5-hour \ `` `` `` `` Advanced\ `` `` `` `` tour , and signed up . Due to weather , we ended up changing days at the last minute , and Dianna was very accomodating .

He obviously has a passion for Charlotte , having grown up there , and it showed . \n\nWe got our full 2.5 hours ( and then some ) , and think that this is probably the best tour we have taken so far on Segways . If you are an experienced rider , I would definitely recommend taking one of the advanced tours . And , ask for Tremaine ! ! ! ``",1,positive
37581,"When this place first opened , my husband , friends , and I really enjoyed it . The food was great , especially the macaroni and cheese . The atmosphere was what you 'd expect when going to a nice dinner out . However , I am not sure what has happened in the last few months . Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options , including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT . Big mistake . We ordered the 2 for $ 20 , which is a little misleading on menu . You 're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza , which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually . Definitely not worth the money . We spent $ 29 with tip for a tiny pizza , two very small salads , and my husband 's iced tea . I would n't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good , but it was not . It was just average . We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed . Also , we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat . Instead , they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I 'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually . However , there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner . Seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early , playing music so loud that we could n't even hear each other speak . This place had more of a sports bar feel with Italian food . If you 're drinking then you 'll probably be ok with the mediocre food . However , if you want a nice dinner , we suggest you go somewhere else . We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse . The food is not as good , the options are few , and the atmosphere has gone downhill . We definitely wo n't be going back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well .",0,negative

37842,"Pretty happy with my first meal of the year in 2015 . The family and I decided to hit up the new Town Square BBQ joint called Pot Liquor . I was thrilled when there was n't a huge crowd for the holiday . It smelled delicious upon entry , and my expectations were pretty high . \nThere was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for . Jazzy , blues , Bbq , bar yet family style type of place . The staff was friendly , and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests . \nMy family ordered three appetizers ; pork rinds , deviled eggs , and burnt ends . The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch . The pork rinds were basic but good . And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table . We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat . The first , a sweet classic barbeque sauce . The second was similar to the first , but more spicy than sweet . I would have preferred more spice actually . The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork . I enjoyed it , the vinegar was not too overwhelming . And then my personal favorite , the white sauce . They describe this as , mayo , horseradish , and seasonings . Do n't pass up on the random white sauce , its freakin ' great ! \nFor our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter . The waitress insisted that with all this meat , between the four of us , we would most likely have leftovers . ( Note : myself , my bf , our kids ages 17 & 12 ) The entree included : 1/2 smoked chicken , 6 baby back ribs , 6 dry rubbed spareribs , Carolina pulled pork , 4 Louisiana hot links and three sides . Let 's just say , we were stuffed , yet our waitress was indeed impressed . Everything had a real smoked flavor . No shortcuts used with this BBQ . \nI also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash , because for $ 20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary 's , so that was a deal in itself ! This is usually a weekend brunch special , but they were offering it because of the holiday . The bloody was great , I had 3 of them , and was feeling it towards the end . \nDo n't ask me how we ate dessert , but we did . I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu , the kids did great . We had the deep fried banana split ( huge and awesome ) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches . Just get those , do n't even ask , just do it . \nDuring our meal , the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction . Although he was a Cowboys fan , we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10 % off , that we were able to use that day . The waitress even let us keep the coupon , which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place .",1,positive
20363,"This place has been well described by others so I will just say that it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison . Pork tacos + some real sugar Coke and some great genuinely hot salsa = happy happy . My Wife loves the tortas and the food is cheap , fast and delicious.\n\nThe only down side for me was that the in-room kitchen put off a bit of grease in the air and during the winter and the place is pretty closed so I had an asthma flare up from breathing the smoke and ended up wheezing my way through my tacos . But I suppose if they had good ventilation the place would not be the quaint , authentic inexpensive gem that it is .",1,positive
25250,"Girl Talk was performing at the outdoor Boulevard Pool area the night I came to The Cosmo . It was a freaking awesome concert , even though it was windy and cold as hell outside . One thing I really like about this hotel is that they have a giant LED screen outside the hotel that shows you all the main events going on live and Girl Talk was no exception.\n\nThe entire hotel is VERY swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at ( ie : the three story Chandelier Bar which is made with $ 30 million worth of real crystals . No wonder everybody complains about Vegas ' economy-maybe you should n't spend that much building a bar lol ) . The location is also very awesome . My only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget ( probably to help pay for that bar haha ) . Good luck trying to find a table for less than $ 50 on the weekends.\n\nHowever , when I become a millionaire , you better believe I 'll be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 something-year-old glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to .",1,positive
34302,"`` After my first experience here , the food was good , but the service ... ditzy . Does anyone who works here know what they 're doing ? I figured they 'd just transitioned to the new downtown location and needed to work out some kinks . The issues were n't bad enough that I would n't come back , so I decided to give them a second chance . \n\nSecond chance , we called in an order to go . Just a large pepperoni pizza , nothing too difficult . The girl on the phone sounded super confused like she did n't know what was going on and my husband even commented that he was worried we 'd get there and there would be a problem with the order . So we get there , I tell them I called in and order , and the 5 people working there all look around at each other and say , \ `` `` `` `` I did n't take an order\ `` `` `` `` . After telling them , \ `` `` `` `` Someone answered the phone because I placed an order\ `` `` `` `` a girl comes out of the back and said she as the one who took the order . She handed us the pizza and did n't say anything . I had to ask what we owed . She looked lost and confused like she was on pills . The rest of the staff then tried to overcompensate by being phony friendly , which I was n't going to buy since one of the girls was on her cell phone texting and would n't look at us . \n\nOverall , the food is n't bad , but I 'm not sure it 's worth dealing with the incompetent staff . I may give them one final chance before writing them off altogether . ``",0,negative
25322,"Seriously the WORST car rental company I have ever experienced . Here 's what to expect if you ever decide to rent a car from FOX in Vegas ( please save your time and money and choose a different car rental company ) \n\n- The rental office is offsite , you 'll need to take 2 shuttles from the airport . They claim it 's to save the airport fees and pass on the savings to the customer . I would be fine with it IF in fact we did save money but they sneak in other charges as well which makes it just as expensive , if not more than other rental companies \n- The customer service is nonexistent there and everything takes forever because there are no workers ! There were 2 workers taking their time with a line of 20 ppl . You 'll end up waiting in line for a good hour to get your rental car . Then wait even more to have someone check out your car and open the gate . You literally have to hunt down a worker for every step of the check out process . \n- Check your receipt before you sign anything ! We made the mistake of not reviewing the receipt carefully and were charged extra for the insurance AND an upgrade ( which seemed complimentary from the clerk at the time ) \n\nUgh , this place is a huge waste of time and money .

If you have a large group of people , your group will be sitting as if you 're sitting on a floor , but your not . The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open . It 's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi ( Eel ) was cooked perfectly . The softcrab shells are not bad , but I had better ones before . The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy . They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation . It was a very simple dish put together . \n\nSake - they are pricey . $ 15.00 minimum . \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty . \n\nOverall , if you are craving for ramen , this is the best place so far I 've tasted . As for sushi , I would only come here once . I 've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before . I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California . Also , if you do n't tip enough . You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip .

Oh , and make sure that you look at an apartment that you would actually be getting , because they show you the better one of the two .

The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other . I did n't try them so I have no idea . \nThey started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out . So much personality . Later we realized he was the owner . \n\nThe Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers , but obviously the red meats were the standouts . No one gave us tongs , so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server , but they worked it out . \n\nThe meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses , but I do think they could do with some sharper knives . Meat quality is good , not great but definitely good . \n\nThis place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that . For me personally , eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience . Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing . Normally that 's not really my thing , but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun . When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around . It was a lot of fun .",1,positive

It 's waay crowded , the employees have somewhat of a lack of communication.\n\nThe positives of this place , it reminds me of home ... the palenke ( however you spell it ) smell . The fish you can inspect yourself for freshness ( I am picky when it comes to fish ) . Also I like the fact they can clean and cook it for you ( for those who are always on the run ) .",0,negative

21579,"`` I 've only been a member for 2 weeks . I am temp in AZ from CO caring for a terminally ill family member . I needed a place to escape for relief . MSF is close . I joined to attend yoga and pilates classes . 2 out of the 5 times I have gone to class there has been a mixup in the schedule . Wed I noticed the online sched differed from the paper sched . I called to find out the correct time and was given the wrong info . Waiting with several other confused members for the class to begin , one of the said \ `` `` `` `` the yoga schedule has been jacked up lately\ `` `` `` `` . It 's not easy for me to get away . I have to hire home health care every time I leave the house . I needed an outlet to relieve stress and get some exercise . MSF has provided the opposite . To add to the so far awful experience , the front desk employees could care less . AND I paid to attend a meditation class and realized I was charged 5.00 too much . After I had to wait 20min to sign up and pay because no one at the front desk had any idea what I was requesting ! I had to direct them to the huge sign advertising the class outside the yoga room instructing to sign up and pay at the front desk . Now I will need to spend more time and frustration trying to get my 5.00 back . Needless to say I will be re-joining the wonderful PEORIA BIKRAM YOGA studio even though it is a long drive . Anyone looking for mind/body classes for stress and exercise ... ..join a REAL yoga studio ! ``",0,negative
19261,"A very nice traditional French bakerie & deli . They have fresh baguette , rolls , desserts , cold case with cheeses , pates , and duck confit . \nWe got a very nice cheese and spinach quiche . They boxed it up with string . Great customer service and wonderful quality .",1,positive

My personal favorites are the Mexican roll and the Dale Earnhardt roll . Not quite sure why they equated Dale Earnhardt with soft shell crab , but it works . \n\nIt 's a bit pricier than other sushi places around town , but it 's less than what you 'll find on the strip or in off-strip casinos , and the freshness and creativity are worth a few extra bucks .",1,positive

33619,"`` Straight up , we did not eat a meal here , we ate dessert only and had drinks . \n\nBeing only a stone throw from my sister 's house and open until late , it was a perfect spot when we decided to do a late dessert before I left early the next morning back home . At 10:30 pm , the run a \ `` `` `` `` late night menu\ `` `` `` `` which had limited yet with variety selection of entrees and desserts . It also had some recommended drinks . \n\nBeing a non-drinker , I have to go by the drinkers ' opinions which were that the drinks were good . Upon investigation of the drink menu , an obscure ingredient made these two Hawaii girls go , hmmm . Li hing mui . Upon further investigation we found out that the bartender was originally from Hawaii . Cool point . \n\nDessert ... ah , even on this late menu , was unique and interesting . At this late hour , one would be forgiving if a place just offered a slice of pie with ice cream on the side . Not here . The were individually prepared and it took time to get it . \n\nI 'll say this much , when an employee/our server knows all the owners and their history , points them all out at 10:30 on a weeknight , and gushes about their hard work , ability to collaborate and be original ; you as business owners , are doing something right . \n\nOverall it seems that this place is ambitious and willing to take the risk , exert the extra energy and push the bill to get people to see that they are not a joke when it comes to creating an original experience . I can safely say this , on this Tuesday night , by the time we left at about midnight , the place was even more crowded then when we came . I am definitely coming back again to try their regular menu . ``",1,positive
13215,"`` I 'm not going to lie , with so many better buffets out there at around the same price , why go here ? This place is a step above Hometown Buffet , and that 's not saying much .

However , you can find the same selection of desserts at any other Vegas buffet . ``",0,negative

I stood at the color wall staring at the sales man as he avoided eye contact with me . I even verbalized the lack off assistance and was ignored . Watched the guy walk in back after actually making eye contact . Horrible service . Maybe they should stick to contractors and stop pretending they like to help the general public .

26045,"Hubby and I successfully climbed a mountain today and , as usual after a successful ascent , I was hungry . Tummy was rumbling and grumbling like a disgruntled bear . I 've been wanting to try Slidin ' Thru NW for a while and today was it . Nothing like a good long hike to give one an excuse to eat really bad food ... ..\n\n ... .and the food was bad in that great wonderful junk food way , except the quality of the ingredients was very high ! I ordered one Plain Jane sans cheese ( regular angus beef slider ) and one Porky ( bbq pulled pork ) and hubby ordered one Pep Pep ( BLT + cheese ) and one Caprese ( as in the salad ) . We shared an order of the sweet potato fries.\n\nGreat flavour and food quality . The Porky bbq sauce is SO GOOD . What do they put in it ? ? Hubby 's Caprese slider was delish as well , featuring a nice blend of the balsamic vinegar with the mozza . Some may feel the prices to be on the high side for baby burgers , but I 'm ok with paying a bit more for quality . ( And , the sliders are n't baby sized . Two plus a side of fries is a decent meal . ) Prices range from $ 2.50- $ 3.50 for sliders and $ 2 for regular fries to $ 3 for the sweet potato fries.\n\nNB : The sweet potato fries are sweet ! Instead of salt , the folks at Slidin ' Thru sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar-y mix over the fries . I prefer my fries salty , so will not order the sweet potato fries again ; that said , the fries were crispy and hot ! \n\nNB # # 2 : Is there a way to avoid the use of styrofoam ? I know that the sliders can get messy and hot sliders are the goal , especially for the drive thru customers , but styrofoam ? Really ? \n\nThe place was super clean when we went earlier today and the staff very enthusiastic about our first-time visit . : )",1,positive

The food was not the best Italian food , but it was excellent . The service was incredible , the best of any restaurant I have visited . I love/hate those two kids . \n\nOh . I have a tip for them . Warm your plates ! My entree did n't have much mass and was cooling down rapidly . I touched the edge of the plate and sure enough , it was cold . Cold plates suck the energy out of food . It 's a basic ! ! !",1,positive
31074,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character , I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him . Oscar Goodman . The ( formerly ) happiest mayor on earth . And former mob defense attorney . He and his image are quintessential Vegas . I had to try his steakhouse . \n\nEntering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night , we were seated right away . Service can only be described as short and surly . From the hostess to the two servers we encountered , I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time . A stark contrast to , say , Vic & Anthony 's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget ( see separate review ) . \n\nThe menu is mob-inspired , consisting of names of gangsters you 'll recognize . I went with the Spilatro 's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes . It may not look like much from the attached photo , bit it was actually quite good . \n\nThe restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career . I think the theme works fine here , and the location is great . It 's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly , directly at the West end of Fremont Street . The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience . It 's an excellent view . \n\nAll in all , the food was good . The theme was fun . But the service not so much . I 'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service . How do other places like Vic 's get it right consistently and places like this do n't ? I think it starts at the top . Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them . Consistently . \n\nOscar 's needs to make an attempt , here . And until they do , the servers will bring down the house . This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week . \n\nI sincerely hope they do bring it around because I 'd like to see this place survive . If enough people point this out to them , maybe they will .",0,negative
32987,"Finally decided to try this place last night , went for happy hour at around 9 pm . The happy hour menu is really good , 2 dollar fish tacos , the 3 dollar garlic chicken is incredible , and all sushi rolls are half off . Plus good deals on drinks as well . The sushi was very good , well prepared , fresh and tasty . Like I said the garlic chicken was also reallly good too , and the mussels were great and only 5.50 for a decent sized portion , next time I go I think I will try more of the tapas than just getting sushi . \n\nOnly complaint is that they need to get a couple TVs on the walls so you can come here to watch a game , etc . Definitely would help the atmosphere IMO",1,positive
31649,"`` I 'm officially addicted to the Mutabel ( babaganush ) at this place ! The Armenians that run this joint have become my buds and know exactly what I like these days . Usually , I pull up to the front of the store located next to Trader Joe 's and the owners are outside sipping espresso and smoking cigarettes like some scene from \ `` `` `` `` Eastern Promises\ `` `` `` `` . For some reason , this relaxed mentality sets the mood for a great meal . I usually get hummus , but the Mutabel is the best in town by far ! The service is sometimes a little awkward , but I forgive it because the staff is also very kind . If you 're in the area , I suggest you make a stop by the Royal Cuisine for a healthy and fresh Armenian lunch or dinner ! ``",1,positive

2255,"`` I 've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots ... usually a decent experience ... This time , however , I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place ( and ultimately alter my desire to come back again ) . \n\nThis particular evening , my sister and I arrived and , though we were n't planning on staying and hanging out ( I just wanted a latte ) , after what we experienced , we decided to leave quickly . \n\nThe place has a nice , local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people , in groups , or on laptops , just chillin ' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all , too . When I went to order my latte , I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk ( I 'm slightly picky about that ) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested . As I was paying ( cash , since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $ 5 ) , he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me , total optimist , thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative , was surprised when he said \ `` `` `` `` yeah , because you have an outside drink and we do n't allow those , so you 'd have to leave\ `` `` `` `` adding a fake sorry face ... my sister , next to me , holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER ... I 'm thinking \ `` `` `` `` really ? ? ? are you serious ? ? \ `` `` `` `` I was super surprised at that statement and frankly , really annoyed . I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP ( not even a Starbucks coffee ) , she has to leave . WTF ! \nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me . We kindly said we 'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway ... \n\nTHEN , as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte ( this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar ) , I shake and shake and the flippin ' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon ... what 's the point ? There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please , why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers ? .. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.\n\nall in all , I 'm not sure I 'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever . Sorry , but I 've experienced better . ``",0,negative
9902,"Spent my 40th birthday stay ( Sept. 2012 ) at TI and had a decent time though I 've had more fun at other resorts . TI 's rooms are spacious and clean and their housekeeping was top notch . I had zero issues with the room my entire 6-day stay there . Buffet was ordinary but I did like some of the drink choices at the various bars . There 's a really good pizza place near Mysterie Theatre but it closes early which makes no sense being that it 's Vegas . 99 % of my late-night eating was done at other resorts . Casino was ok. Won $ 50 at blackjack one day , lost it the next . I was there the opening weekend of the college football season so there seemed to be a lot of UNLV fans there , which was cool . They were all fun people . I did not see Mysterie but instead went across the street to see La Reve at The Wynn . The underlying theme of my birthday stay at TI was that most of my adventures were done elsewhere . The Syrens show was interesting the first time then got tiring every time you walk by it for a week . I 'd probably stay there again ONLY if I got a discounted room which I got from the booking agent because it was my birthday .",0,negative
