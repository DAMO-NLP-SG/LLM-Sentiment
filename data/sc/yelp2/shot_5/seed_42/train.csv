"`` I was looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant close to work and stumbled across Susie 's . Similar in price to Filiberto 's but the serving sizes were n't quite as big as Filiberto 's is ( that 's fine with me ; I actually prefer \ `` `` `` `` normal\ `` `` `` `` serving sizes . ) Loved the soft tacos ! Ate there while on lunch break so did n't get to try the 1 cent beer with lunch , but made me want to go back on a Saturday to check it out ! ``",1,positive
"`` I have had some very interesting times at the Spearmint Rhino , and despite still being one of the \ `` `` `` `` big names\ `` `` `` `` in the industry , the place has gone downhill in the past couple of years . It 's still one of the best clubs during the weekend or when they have a Headliner performing , but other clubs have just as much or more to offer . \n\nThe Spearmint Rhino does have some of the better looking dancers in Vegas , but most of them are very unfriendly and their hustle is so obvious that it 's a turnoff . I realize that it 's a job , but I 'm used to the ladies buttering up the customers and chatting them up before asking for a dance - not asking and then immediately leaving . Many of the ladies sat by themselves and appeared disinterested . \n\nMy most recent visit was a nightmare . ( I go to Strip Clubs to check out very attractive women , 8+ ... if you know what I mean . ) On this particular visit , there was n't even a 7 in the entire club , and I 'm usually a bit forgiving . This is not a knock on the ladies - just an honest assessment of the club . On top of the disappointment , all of the ladies were cold as ice . I completely understand the economics of a Strip Club , that 's why I walk in with my \ `` `` `` `` strip club\ `` `` `` `` roll , but the cold disinterested thing only works for the irresistibly hot women ... not for the women working that night . \n\nI purchased a soda - tipped the waitress . Nobody came up to me during the 10 minutes that I sipped on my soda , so I left after being in there for a total of 15-20 minutes . I usually play a game , like \ `` `` `` `` the next lady to talk to me will get $ 20 , \ `` `` `` `` but nobody came up to me before I left . I actually gave one of the dancers a few bucks on my out of the restroom because I ca n't leave without tipping at least one dancer . By the way , the dancers on stage were some of the worst I 've seen in a while - in terms of attitude . Some of them actually stood and did nothing because the action around the stage was weak.\n\nBased on my last visit , I would not dare a return visit , but I have had good times here so I am willing to give it another try . Keep in mind that there are other major clubs in the area with equally hot women . ``",0,negative
"Had a great time with my beautiful wife listening to The Instant Classics . Drinks are pricey and menu seems a little limited , but I had a great time . Looking forward sharing Blue Martini and TIC with friends .",1,positive
"I have been to this location multiple times and every time the service is horrendous and the food is mediocre . Not sure if the location being in a mall has to do with it , but stay away unless you are really disparate for some grub .",0,negative
"So here 's my deal . \nLast time I was in Vegas I was part of a bachlorette party and promoters approached us nonstop . \nThis time around I was nervous because I would be going to Vegas with the family.\nThe familia agreed to watch the kids for one night while the hubs and I partied it up . \nBUT ! ! ! \nPromoters do n't approach you if you 're surrounded by kids and grandparents . \nThats a fact . \nSo I contacted Stacia and she was freakin AWESOME . She hooked up my husband and I with VIP entrance into XS ! ! ! ! \n\nNext time I 'm in Vegas , whether with the family or a big ol group of girls , I 'm definitely contacting Stacia . . . .AND YOU SHOULD TOO ! ! ! ! ! !",1,positive
"Do not stay here . I reserved two rooms at this hotel for my family based on the positive reviews on yelp . It was horrible . 1 ) High resort fees on two rooms , 2 ) the rooms were spacious but they smelled of vomit and tobacco and they gave us only one towel per room , 3 ) our room was not ready until 6:00 pm and the pool closed at 8:00 pm , 4 ) the rooms were far apart from each other , 5 ) only one elevator worked with hundreds of teens at a conference riding up and down , 6 ) too far from the strip , 7 ) no vending and ice machines , 8 ) no prices on in-room refrigerator , and 9 ) the place was like O'Hare airport . It was not relaxing . When I complained to the desk , they apologized and said they had a lot of kids this weekend . Unbelievable . I will never stay here again .",0,negative
Love.\nI only wish it was easier to access for locals . This one is on the strip & not easy to get to . I parked at Cosmo & walked over . Took about ten-fifteen min.\n\nI had the pomegranate with Pom sauce & blueberries ! Such good quality and fresh ingredients . I like that the toppings are done for you . It just seems more sanitary . ( I hate buffets ) \n\nPraying for a local shop soon ! \nTOWN SQUARE !,1,positive
"`` I love dancing ! It 's been a while since I 've gone out and where I 've been out in Arizona . My friend and I planned our annual Scottsdale dance night and this year the best night for us ended up on Wednesday . \n\nI could tell it had been a LONG time since I 've done the club scene since most of my old stomping ground was either permanently closed , getting remodeled , or just closed on \ `` `` `` `` hump day.\ `` `` `` `` Myst was the only club open in the Old Town Scottsdale area . When we got there , they told us that it was 18 and up on Wednesday nights and that people do n't really show up until 11:30pm . It 's also a $ 10 cover . Also , if you check your coat it 's an additional $ 5 . The 21 and older crowd can go upstairs and get drinks . \n\nThe dance floor is a pretty good size ; however , the music was n't the best and seemed like the same thing over and over . I like current songs that you can occasionally sing along to and I think there was maybe one by Beyonce . \n\nThe crowd was young and many were all over each other . It made me embarrassed for some of the women there and then disappointed in the men for trying to handle women inappropriately . It is unusual for me to leave a club early and to not dance , but this was just not a good vibe or crowd . Whatever happened to dress nicely ? Many of the guys just showed up in jeans and a flannel shirt . Seriously . The club looked warn and not kept up ( e.g . , holes in walls , could use a new paint job in the bathrooms , and not all the lights were on ) . \n\nDancing is fun , but not for me at Myst . Maybe it 's the economy , but Myst has seen its better days and it 's going to take a lot to get back to that . ``",0,negative

"First..they have Happy hour 7 days a week . WooHoo ! 1st time was on a lazy weekend afternoon for Happy Hour . The sushi rolls on the menu were decent but not all that elaborate , your basic rolls..so I think I would prefer the extended menu . However what I wish to absolutely rave about is the $ 2 Roka Burger offered at Happy Hour . Best freakin burger , I ca n't even tell you.. but I will try and at a sushi place no less ! ! The meat tastes like it was soaked in a broth that is unbelievable , with a hint of wasabi . Topped with avocado..it 's just amazing . I will be back for the burger alone and I want to try this Hamachi Chili Roll that everyone 's talking about.\n\nP.S . I wo n't give any restaurant 5 stars unless Ive been there at least 3 times and they remain consistent.. hence the 4 star .",1,positive
