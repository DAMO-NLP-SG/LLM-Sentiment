"Excellent choice if you want to stay centrally on the Strip and not shell out huge bucks . It 's not CHEAP , but it 's no Caesar 's . The amenities are n't as grand , but how long are you in your room/hotel and look at what 's in walking distance : Bellagio , Paris , Bally 's , Casear 's , Mirage , TI , Wynn . It 's awesome . I recommend my friends stay here if they 're staying on the Strip .",1,positive
"I have two cats and five Ferrets , and Dr. Molina and her team have been amazing with them . I had six Ferrets , but one had cancer , and Dr. Molina researched everything she could and with her knowledge with Ferrets ( which is amazing ) she helped me keep my precious Pocket with us for much longer than we hoped for , and she was a happy girl to the end . This Team of wonderful caring and very knowledgeable women make my life with my little farm a happy one .",1,positive
"Our experience with the office staff has been unpleasant every time , both on the phone and in person for visits . The wait is always long ( atleast an hour , even first thing in the morning ) and it takes forever to get your questions answered . \nThey are incompetent when it comes to billing/insurance issues and have completely overlooked our past records from other pediatricians ( which would have given our child 4 immunizations that he 'd already been given . ) In order to get an immunization record , we needed to make an appointment for an office visit . \nThe pediatrician was short with us , seemed annoyed with any questions , and basically told us to go to the ER if we had a concern . \nWe are never coming back here . This place came recommended , but apparently it 's not for informed parents who want to be involved in their child 's healthcare .",0,negative

"Casino awesome ! Rooms , HORRIBLE ! ... \n\nMake sure you bring a full body condom if u plan on sleeping here , or perhaps create your own from recycled ones found in your room . No tide stick is big enough to clean the stains on the furniture and I thought my mind was playing games w me but in retrospect , the bedsheets were untucked upon arrival ! My legs were sore from standing in my room and made sure I put my sneakers on for the long walk out of the bathroom to my suitcase in the other room , \n \nThe casino was actually pretty cool but there is only one visible cashier all the way at the back which I thought was lame.\n\nWould n't stay here again !",0,negative

"The baby and I decided to take a peek at this Korean market . Everyone was very friendly and the store was nice and clean . I felt strangely comfortable in the store , making sure to check out everything they had in there . Ever since we ( me + hubby ) were stationed in Korea back in the day , I 've been looking for those little bottles that had the magic hangover potion , Bacchus-D. FOUND IT ! Had no idea what it was called , but recognized the bottle and the box . It was also on sale , yay for paying less money for things that I would have payed full price for ! We also picked-up some OB & Hi-Lite , for memory sake . The hubby much appreciated it.\n\nSo the baby fell asleep while her mommy was wondering the aisles , so I stopped by their food court . There were many places to choose from , but I decided to grab something from the one non-Korean place , I Love Oshi . I picked up their udon special with a spicy ahi tuna roll . Not too bad , but I did love the nice and runny poached egg in my soup.\n\nWe will be back and maybe , if he behaves , we 'll bring the hubby/daddy along too !",1,positive

I went in for laser removal and the whole skin design family was great ! Anthony made me feel very comfortable with the whole process keeping me informed as far as what to expect . Prior during and after the procedure . Definitely a place you should check out . Will go back for more . Also all the artist are very good and award winning . I have a bunch of ink by Pako n we recently won a bunch of awards at the Philadelphia tattoo convention . Skin design best shop in town .,1,positive
