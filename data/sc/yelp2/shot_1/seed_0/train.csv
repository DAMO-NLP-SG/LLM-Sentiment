"It does n't look like much from the outside ; in fact , Zack 's looks like it 's in need of a facelift , but do n't let that deter you . Zack 's makes some of the best burgers in town . Quick , relatively inexpensive , and absolutely delicious . \n\nTry the Zack 's Special ; basically it 's what a Big Mac should taste like , if McDonald 's were actually in the business of making real burgers . And it 's probably cheaper than a Big Mac , too . \n\nZack 's is no-frills . No fancy menus , no fancy sauces , just good old-fashioned burgers and hot dogs and fries done right . There 's also fried chicken and ribeye sandwiches to be had ; I might have to sample them the next few times I go back to Zacks 's . \n\nIn short , Zack 's is an institution , and rightly so . You do n't stay in business this long by making bad burgers .",1,positive
"Thought I reviewed this place already . Since it 's been about a year and a half since I last ate here ( twice visited , ate once ) , I plan to give SK another try very soon . Thought I 'd just get the ball rolling now ... \n\nI met with a few people here the first time , but was n't feeling hungry enough , so I just joined in the conversations and just observed the food as they were delivered to the table . Most of my companions that night did n't actually order sushi , and instead , opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes . The low menu prices did pique my interest , so when hunger pangs struck me a couple of hours later , I asked relatives if they wanted to join me for sushi ( and they did ) .\n\nAs noted in the number of stars I posted above , I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening . I found the sushi ( vinegared rice ) lacking in the flavor department , and the roll ingredients to be subpar . The selections we shared between us were so bland , I ca n't even recall which rolls and nigiri we had ordered ! \n\nSince it 's been almost two years , and a lot can change in two years ( for good or bad ) , I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try .",0,negative
