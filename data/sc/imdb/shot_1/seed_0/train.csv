"Simple story ... why say more ? It nails it 's premise . World War 3 kills all or most of the human race and we 're viewing 2 of the survivors . The message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place . Distilled down to representatives from each side , we see they have everything to come together for : < br / > < br / > Security ... Finding resources ... food , shelter , etc ... Survival ... Love ... < br / > < br / > At the end they 've decided to pool their resources , ( she finally does ) , so they will survive . Simple story , expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape . We see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable . In the early 60s , no one had seen such stuff ... I give it a 10 ...",1,positive
"This film is not funny . It is not entertaining . It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence , nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation . Added to that it 's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory . It 's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like . This movie is boring , obnoxiously mind-numbing , and at times offensive and disgusting . At most , it contains one or two moments that make you laugh . Also , it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time .",0,negative
