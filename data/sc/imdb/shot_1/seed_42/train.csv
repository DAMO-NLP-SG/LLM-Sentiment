I 've seen the original English version on video . Disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . The animation quality is excellent ! If you 've seen Disney 's job of Kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) Finally Miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! I ca n't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa !,1,positive
"`` This is a depressingly shallow , naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks ' psychotic film editor and Harold , his vapid girlfriend . The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career ; but also because Brooks ' character is neither interesting nor likeable . There are 15 static , excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks , having just broke up with Harold , stumbles about his apartment in a depressed , drugged out state - unbearable. < br / > < br / > Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker 's `` '' You Are So Beautiful '' '' , there simply is not enough material here for a feature film . There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world . I 'm sure Brooks ' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and , in a way , deconstruct it ; but if you 're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here .
