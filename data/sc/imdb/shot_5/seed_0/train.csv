"Oh God , what an idiotic movie ! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects ( the creature is played by one guy in lame costume ) and stupid plot.All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ( HA ! HA ! HA ! ) ... they 're simply ludicrous.For example I have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk ( these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more ) .All in all , this is a great entertainment if you 're drunk.Avoid it like the plague.Am I drunk ? I do n't think so ...",0,negative
"`` A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck . `` `` Mirage '' '' is obviously inspired by Spielberg 's `` '' Duel '' '' and Craven 's `` '' The Hills Have Eyes '' '' .Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The film 's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak , but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall , if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10 .

"`` Fox 's `` '' The True Story Of Jesse James '' '' ( 1957 ) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power/Henry Fonda classic `` '' Jesse James '' '' . I 'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters , the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it. < br / > < br / > In the late thirties and forties Tyrone Power was Fox 's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head Darryl Zanuck started to groom newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place . This was a major error on Zanuck 's part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement . With the possible exceptions of `` '' Broken Lance '' '' ( 1954 ) and `` '' Between Heaven & Hell '' '' ( 1956 ) it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything ! Also , Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagner 's Jesse in `` '' The True Story Of Jesse James '' '' . Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor 's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford 's classic `` '' The Searchers '' '' . But his playing here , along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers , is nothing short of boring . Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles . They totally miss the mark , lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original . The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner , as the Robin Hood of the American west , comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever . The supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely getting a look in as Ma James. < br / > < br / > The best aspects of this uninvolving so-so western is the wonderful Cinemascope/Colour cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer Leigh Harline !

"`` In 1930 , Europe received quite a shock when Luis Bunuel 's ' L'Age Dor ' was released , causing a riot in Paris when screened there , resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years . Three years later , in 1933 , when Europe had gotten over the shock , it was once again turned on it 's ear with 'Ekstase ' , a symphony ( of sorts ) to love . The film starred a young , unknown German actress named Hedwig Kiesler , who would later change her name to Hedy Lamarr , when she moved to America to escape the madness of Adolf Hitler , as Eva , a young bride who has just married a cold , distant loveless husband ( played by Emil Jerman ) , only to discover that she has made a major mistake . One divorce later , Eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day , skinny dipping in a lake , when she discovers Adam , a handsome , young engineer ( played by Aribert Mog ) who takes a real fancy to her ( and she , him ) . After a wild night of passion , Eva 's ex-husband turns up once again , hoping to win Eva back , only to find he now has a rival . I wo n't spoil what transpires . Czech director , Gustav Machaty ( who directed the original screen version of 'Madam X ' , another parable in romantic obsession ) directs from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel , Frantisek Horky & Machaty , from the novel by Robert Horky . The film 's velvety cinematography ( which reminded me of Avant Garde photographer , Man Ray 's photos of the era , which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow , a lot ) is by Hans Androschin & Jan Stallich ) . The film 's brisk editing is by Antonin Zelenka & the films art direction , which goes for a lush , nearly Art Deco look , is by Bohumil Hes ) . If I have any quirk about this film , it is the music score , by Giuseppe Becce , which goes for an over the top , melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast ( certain themes are repeated over & over again , wearing out it 's welcome , fast -- -kind of like some of David Lean 's over use of certain musical themes , especially in 'Lawrence Of Arabia ' , and 'Dr.Zhivago ' ) . Some years back , a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material , cobbled together from various European existing prints available , restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the Vatican condemned it as `` '' decadent '' '' ( yeah , right ... like the Church never did anything wrong ) , and the Hayes office cut it to ribbons , when it was finally released in the U.S.A. in 1936 , in a `` '' Hayes Office '' '' approved cut ( likewise ) . Minimal dialog in German with English subtitles ( it was meant to be a mainly visual experience ) . Not rated , but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by Hedy Lamarr ( done tastefully , mind you ) & some suggestions of sexual content ( likewise ) that would scarcely earn it a PG-13 rating , nowadays . Worth a look if you have any interest in early European cinema , or Avant Garde/Experimental cinema ''",1,positive
"While the overall idea of Escape from Atlantis was intriguing , I found the film to be far less than what I had hoped for upon reading the plot summery . Perhaps I am too much of a child in the technological age : the movie was made , as it is now 2002 , an official five years ago -- after viewing fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings , and science fiction feats like Star Wars , as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as Dinotopia or Homer 's The Odyssey. < br / > < br / > My beef , basically , is that I could n't relate -- I am just about the same age of the children ( a young adult ) , and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available . But the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence . I did n't find myself saying 'ACK ! I would have done the SAME thing ! ' . It did not open the doors to my imagination . Even without comparing it to high-budget films or other TV movies , standing alone , certain aspects of the feature I found to be cliche : The character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking , seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run . Even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement : a typical set of one or the other stereotypes . There was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious , accompanied by Mr . Perfect image of combining athletics , good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude , and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days . While I know the personalities pushed the story along , I think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable -- and believable ( as far as character ) -- movie. < br / > < br / > I do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design -- that made it worth finishing to the end for me . Do n't get me wrong : all movies are worth seeing for yourself , and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many , but I think that with a little more depth to the script , and a little more ( I can not believe I am saying this ) realness I dare say Escape from Atlantis could have been magical .",0,negative
"`` This `` '' tragicomedy '' '' written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category . And yet , its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value . A masterpiece one should not miss to see ( preferably with subtitles , and not dubbed ) . < br / > < br / > In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade , a looming war decides the passengers ' behaviour . Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come ; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie ( real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors , but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who 's plowed the road give a real-life performance ) . < br / > < br / > The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war , an insight into nation 's collective person : everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can , hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy . Using a simple movie language , director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war ( World War I ) , but also highlights personal portraits with success : provincialism of a singer , inexperience of the newlyweds , seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son , and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. < br / > < br / > Brilliant in its narration , with memorable soundtrack ( especialy the Gispsy songs ) and adjusted atmosphere , well photographed and edited , this feature ( Sijan 's feature debut ) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s : `` '' Maratonci trce pocasni krug '' '' , `` '' Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota '' '' , and my other director 's favourite `` '' Davitelj protiv davitelja '' '' ) .

"`` Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company ( with Disney keeping the Miramax brand ) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few . THE FLOCK is a prime example. < br / > < br / > A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders , this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. < br / > < br / > Richard Gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task . Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role ( instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in ) and she makes the most of playing the novice . The cinematography , pacing , editing , all of it is first rate -- - and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about . The subject is handled with restraint , but it 's still a tough subject and might make you sick. < br / > < br / > Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded . Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the `` '' rights '' '' of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper 's paradise for sexual perversity , both willing and unwilling . Each such step was met with praise by Liberals , who celebrated the Warren Court 's ill deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek . Everyday liberals also praised the Court 's action and mocked those who disagree . In 2007 how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to , and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office . Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone 's family to shreds. < br / > < br / > Richard Gere is a Liberal , but he gives his best in his performance here . Perhaps in his maturing age he 's gained a measure of wisdom . ''",1,positive
"This movie is NOT funny . It just takes the D & D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them . All the main characters make less than 30k a year , they all live with their parents , they 're all socially retarded , and they have no luck with women . The jokes are horrible and unimaginative , such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on ( it was his wizard costume ) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up ( oh how funny , he 's a nerd so he does n't know about sports ) . You may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny . Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch , but obviously extremely cheap to make . I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo . I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime .",0,negative
"This film is not funny . It is not entertaining . It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence , nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation . Added to that it 's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory . It 's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like . This movie is boring , obnoxiously mind-numbing , and at times offensive and disgusting . At most , it contains one or two moments that make you laugh . Also , it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time .",0,negative
"Simple story ... why say more ? It nails it 's premise . World War 3 kills all or most of the human race and we 're viewing 2 of the survivors . The message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place . Distilled down to representatives from each side , we see they have everything to come together for : < br / > < br / > Security ... Finding resources ... food , shelter , etc ... Survival ... Love ... < br / > < br / > At the end they 've decided to pool their resources , ( she finally does ) , so they will survive . Simple story , expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape . We see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable . In the early 60s , no one had seen such stuff ... I give it a 10 ...",1,positive
