"`` I began watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon , thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick . I was wrong. < br / > < br / > '' '' Pandora 's Clock '' '' is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV movies . It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. < br / > < br / > The cast is excellent , including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson , Edward Herrmann , Robert Guillaume , and Robert Loggia . Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA , and Frasier 's Jane Leeves is also very good . < br / > < br / > The dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout . In fact , the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you ca n't leave your seat for a second . If you get a chance to see this movie , invest the time -- nearly four hours . You will be richly rewarded ! ''",1,positive
"`` DR. SEUSS ' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / ( 2000 ) ** ( out of four ) < br / > < br / > If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable , do n't see `` '' Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . '' '' If you are old enough to read this review , then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture . It contains lots of colors , creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction , joyous load noises , and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville . Unfortunately that is where the movie 's positive elements end ; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin , all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do. < br / > < br / > Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville , so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read . However , I will say that the movie 's story is executed in three major acts ; the development of the grinch and setting , the Whoville festival , and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who 's from their Christmas . There are many familiar names within the credits here , but no familiar faces . Like in `` '' Battlefield Earth , '' '' I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes . Regardless , there is SNL 's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou , the wife of Bill Irwin , the later playing Lou Lou , the father of little Cindy Lou , played by Taylor Momsen . Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor , Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film 's narrator , and Christine Baranski is the Grinch 's lone lost lover. < br / > < br / > The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou . The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape ; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable , too extensive , and contrived . The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself , all of the other characters are puppets of the plot , shapeless and uninteresting . And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic . Example-Grinch : Oh , the Who-manity ! < br / > < br / > The movie 's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith , the costume designer Rita Ryack , and the ample makeup department . `` `` How the Grinch Stole Christmas '' '' is a very good-looking production . The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative ; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream . The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup , to the point in which we can not tell the actor reciting the humorless lines . Although dazzling , I really ca n't give credit to the performances , for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place. < br / > < br / > Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about . His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch , too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss . Surprisingly , although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences , no laughs come from Jim Carry 's zany silliness . It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part . This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy , which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic `` '' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . `` `` < br / > < br / > After this movie , historians should check the coffin of the late author , Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave. < br / > < br / > ''",0,negative
I 've seen the original English version on video . Disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . The animation quality is excellent ! If you 've seen Disney 's job of Kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) Finally Miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! I ca n't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa !,1,positive
"`` This is a depressingly shallow , naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks ' psychotic film editor and Harold , his vapid girlfriend . The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career ; but also because Brooks ' character is neither interesting nor likeable . There are 15 static , excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks , having just broke up with Harold , stumbles about his apartment in a depressed , drugged out state - unbearable. < br / > < br / > Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker 's `` '' You Are So Beautiful '' '' , there simply is not enough material here for a feature film . There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world . I 'm sure Brooks ' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and , in a way , deconstruct it ; but if you 're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here .

"`` `` '' The Good Earth '' '' is a great movie that you do n't hear much about anymore . There are a lot of big disasters and events , but it is also a non-passionate love story . All of this happens in a little over two hours , which is short by today 's standards . The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period. < br / > < br / > I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role . She basically only has three emotions : submissive , hungry , and heart-broken. < br / > < br / > The performances by the Asian and Asian-American actors are terrific. < br / > < br / > ''",1,positive
"This inferior sequel based by the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard ( also producer ) concern on a matrimony named Gene ( Michael Woods ) and Karen York ( Faye Grant ) . They adopt a little girl named Delia from a convent . Gene York about re-elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee . Meanwhile , Delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen . She creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair , as stores of numerology , therapy , counselling heal , yoga , tarots , among others are destroyed . Karen York hires an eye private ( Michael Lerner ) to investigate the weird and bizarre events. < br / > < br / > This TV sequel displays thrills , chills , creepy events and gory killing . Delia such as Damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film , happening horrible killings . The chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects . Furthermore , mediocre protagonists , Faye Grant and Michael Woods , however nice cast secondary , such as Michael Lerner , Madison Mason , Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis , he was an Army captain turned into acting . As always , excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith . The movie is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga . The motion picture is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard . Previous and much better versions are the following : The immensely superior original 'Omen ' ( Gregory Peck , Lee Remick ) by Richard Donner ; 'Damien ' ( William Holden , Lee Grant ) by Don Taylor ; 'Final conflict ' ( Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow ) by Grahame Baker . Rating : Below average .",0,negative
"`` Writer/director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film , `` '' Panic , '' '' from the year 2000 , and that includes his choice of cast : William H. Macy , Tracy Ullman , John Ritter , Neve Campbell , Donald Sutherland , Barbara Bain , David Dorfman . Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles , and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. < br / > < br / > '' '' Panic '' '' is the story of a hit man , Alex ( Macy ) who actually works for his father ( Sutherland ) . He covers his true profession by doing mail order work ; by all appearances , he and his wife ( Ullman ) and their son Sammy ( Dorfman ) are a typical suburban family . Unhappy with his life , Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ( Ritter ) , telling only his mother ( Bain ) . In the waiting room , he meets a young woman ( Campbell ) to whom he is immediately attracted , which complicates his situation further . His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist . When Alex receives his next assignment , he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. < br / > < br / > This is a profound story of a gentle , good man made into a killer by a monster of a father , with his mother 's knowledge , who kills to please his father but also ca n't stand up to him and quit . His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it 's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression . When it 's time for `` '' Panic '' '' to moves , it does - quickly. < br / > < br / > '' '' Panic '' '' does n't seem panicked at all . In fact , it moves very slowly . But it moves slowly not because it 's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate , mirroring Alex 's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog . By making a decision about Sara , the Campbell character , and by seeing his mark , his own psychiatrist , as a living , breathing human being , Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they do n't jive . And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche , Sammy's. < br / > < br / > William Macy gives another brilliant performance , as a loving father , a distant husband , and a cold killer , the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires , a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated. < br / > < br / > This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater . It 's too adult , too small , too subtle , too character-driven , and too good . ''",1,positive
"`` 90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill ... Mindy prances at the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of `` '' shepherd 's bread , '' '' Mindy nearly gets gang-raped ... Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure did n't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2 ) After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend `` '' Pan '' '' is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road . Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps , `` '' I 'm going ' to Big Sur ! ! '' '' But again , it 's a lot more fun to talk/read about than sit through . ''",0,negative
"Six different couples . Six different love stories . Six different love angles . Eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater . Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. < br / > < br / > I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what 's going on in the movie . All stories have got no link with each other , but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them . I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write . The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. < br / > < br / > My suggestion . Do n't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie .",0,negative
"`` I saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in Nürnberg , and it was superb . I do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film , but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic Nibelungen saga. < br / > < br / > If you are interested in silent films or in the Nibelungenlied , I highly recommend this film . The costumes were fantastic and creative , the sets were opulent and exotic , and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking ( as is typical of silent film `` '' tragedies '' '' ) Unfortunately , I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried . The story of this second film begins after Siegfried 's death , when Kremhild ( Gudrun in the Norse versions of the story ) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers. < br / > < br / > Also , I watched this film in German ; I am a native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge . It was difficult to read the ? subtitles ( what do you call that in silent films ? ) at first because of the old style German script , so I advise that if you watch it in German that you make sure you can differentiate your `` '' k 's '' '' , `` '' f 's '' '' , and `` '' s 's '' '' in the old script . : ) ''",1,positive
