"This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie . Face it , you ca n't . Because that way there 's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot , have meaningless transitions , trite , unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd. < br / > < br / > I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie , really I did ; I like lots of crappy movies . But once I 've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY , DEAR LORD , WHY ? more than a few times , I really ca n't take it any more. < br / > < br / > Also , I would love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene .",0,negative
"A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . Obviously , It was first conceived into this world for the stage , but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end . Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . All in all , though , A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact .",1,positive
"Very smart , sometimes shocking , I just love it . It shoved one more side of David 's brilliant talent . He impressed me greatly ! David is the best . The movie captivates your attention for every second .",1,positive
"... Bad at being intentionally bad ... < br / > < br / > This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen . While it 's obvious the movie is n't trying to be taken seriously ( Hopefully that their goal , anyway ... ) , the movie is still plain bad . Hell , it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted ... < br / > < br / > In short : Paint my muscle car prune colored !",0,negative
"Words can not describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . It is a series of random , unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady ( REALLY disturbing ) . The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco , the best actor in this movie . Also , it is rated NC-17 , shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .",0,negative
"`` So , American Pie : Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series . Although , it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it ( ca n't that guy get better gigs ? ) . < br / > < br / > There is very little to compliment this movie on . There are n't any funny jokes . The acting is painful to watch , especially the girl with the `` '' southern '' '' accent which sounds more like a Canadian 's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word `` '' ya 'll . '' '' This movie makes me feel like such an idiot . Why did n't I apply to a college where nobody goes to class ( but everybody gets good grades ) , girls consistently take their clothes off in public , everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs , and you can ejaculate all over a girl 's family photos without her minding ? Really , this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn . Maybe for the next one , they 'll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead . I 'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stifler 's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that . ''",0,negative
"We bought this film from a shop called Poundland . We were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film No Big Deal an remade it. < br / > < br / > We expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube . HOWEVER , this was shocking . BORING is the main word that comes to mind . The bad effects and script are n't enough to make you watch it . The main woman 's body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested . However , it just makes you wonder , did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off ? If so , I 'd have asked for a refund ! It looks like a homemade film , the shots do n't even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional . I CAN NOT believe that this is being sold as a marketable product. < br / > < br / > IT IS JUST BORING and UGLY to watch . The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it . There are no words to describe how terrible it is .",0,negative
"`` When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee , I made sure to see it . This Taiwanese director burst into fame with `` '' The Wedding Banquet '' '' and `` '' Eat Drink Man Woman '' '' a few years ago and then moved on to `` '' Sense and Sensibility '' '' and `` '' The Ice Storm '' '' . Now , he turns his attention to another American icon -- the Civil War. < br / > < br / > This story takes place in Missouri , a Union state with Southern sympathies . These never officially joined the Confederate army . Instead , they formed outlaw bands , called `` '' bushwhackers '' '' , grew they hair long , and sometimes would confiscated Union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing. < br / > < br / > The movie depicts their moral dilemma , the high drama of the times , and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the Union . There are no stars in this movie , unless you consider `` '' Jewel '' '' the singer , well cast as a young confederate widow as a star. < br / > < br / > Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the Germans were supposed Union sympathizers . This young man is an excellent actor , full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he 's exposed to the horror of war. < br / > < br / > Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom . He gives a fine and understated performance. < br / > < br / > Some of the acting , however , is wooden , especially in the long conversations they have about morality . And their costumes are too new . And the `` '' southern gentleman '' '' theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women 's arms , then burn down the stores and houses. < br / > < br / > While I do n't think that this will go down as one of Lee Ang 's `` '' great '' '' movies , I did find myself fascinated by it , in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes . I was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history. < br / > < br / > Not as much action as the usual war movie , but yet still recommended -- especially for Civil War buffs. < br / > < br / > ''",1,positive
"`` You have to see it to believe it ! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great , it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor , unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie , with people , love scenes , and so on . I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet . Finally , it has nothing to do with Al Gore 's documentary-movie `` '' An inconvenient truth '' '' mainly made of long monologues , painfully and with `` '' truths '' '' not always accurate , as many scientists have pointed already . < br / > < br / > The best thing you can do on earth is not miss Earth .

"I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . This happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television . The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks , I started to get interesting . When he said his main influence was The Station Agent , a movie I 'd seen on DVD a week prior , I decided I had to go and check it out . The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . As far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .",1,positive
