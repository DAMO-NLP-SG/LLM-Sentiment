"`` This is a depressingly shallow , naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks ' psychotic film editor and Harold , his vapid girlfriend . The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career ; but also because Brooks ' character is neither interesting nor likeable . There are 15 static , excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks , having just broke up with Harold , stumbles about his apartment in a depressed , drugged out state - unbearable. < br / > < br / > Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker 's `` '' You Are So Beautiful '' '' , there simply is not enough material here for a feature film . There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world . I 'm sure Brooks ' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and , in a way , deconstruct it ; but if you 're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here .

"The movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic , more pastiche Dead or Alive : strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers . But when a police officer is killed , one Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved , things get bloody quite fast. < br / > < br / > An earlier work of Miike 's , Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol ' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts , though it 's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces . Rather , it 's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction , as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground , a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys ( one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning ) . Tatsuhito 's brother is getting involved with said society , so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm. < br / > < br / > What 's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis , Wang . Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China , later moved back into Japan , and alienated for it . Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China , so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan . Wang also is a surprisingly Shakespearian character , which is weird enough as it is , much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be . And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he 's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother . While it would be rude to state that Miike 's movies are successful mostly on their shock value , it is true that sometimes it 's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter , dis-impassioned characters. < br / > < br / > -- PolarisDiB",1,positive
"After seeing You 've Got Mail and feeling disappointed , I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one , The Shop Around the Corner . I was amazed at this movie . It 's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times . The acting is so perfect , the story is so beautiful , that if you have n't seen it , I wish to urge you to see it today . I 'm not against re-makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one , but this time have to admit that You 've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic . Do n't miss it , go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today !",1,positive
"`` DR. SEUSS ' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / ( 2000 ) ** ( out of four ) < br / > < br / > If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable , do n't see `` '' Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . '' '' If you are old enough to read this review , then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture . It contains lots of colors , creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction , joyous load noises , and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville . Unfortunately that is where the movie 's positive elements end ; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin , all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do. < br / > < br / > Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville , so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read . However , I will say that the movie 's story is executed in three major acts ; the development of the grinch and setting , the Whoville festival , and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who 's from their Christmas . There are many familiar names within the credits here , but no familiar faces . Like in `` '' Battlefield Earth , '' '' I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes . Regardless , there is SNL 's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou , the wife of Bill Irwin , the later playing Lou Lou , the father of little Cindy Lou , played by Taylor Momsen . Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor , Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film 's narrator , and Christine Baranski is the Grinch 's lone lost lover. < br / > < br / > The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou . The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape ; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable , too extensive , and contrived . The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself , all of the other characters are puppets of the plot , shapeless and uninteresting . And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic . Example-Grinch : Oh , the Who-manity ! < br / > < br / > The movie 's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith , the costume designer Rita Ryack , and the ample makeup department . `` `` How the Grinch Stole Christmas '' '' is a very good-looking production . The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative ; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream . The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup , to the point in which we can not tell the actor reciting the humorless lines . Although dazzling , I really ca n't give credit to the performances , for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place. < br / > < br / > Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about . His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch , too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss . Surprisingly , although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences , no laughs come from Jim Carry 's zany silliness . It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part . This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy , which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic `` '' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . `` `` < br / > < br / > After this movie , historians should check the coffin of the late author , Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave. < br / > < br / > ''",0,negative
"I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole , Susannah York , Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching . Alas , I was wrong . Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly . I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about . I 've a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister ( York ) . He is also barking mad . But apart from that , your guess is as good as mine. < br / > < br / > The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever . I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary , unimaginative , stagy piffle . Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director . Risible .",0,negative
"A woman ( Sylvia Kristel ) seduces a 15 year old boy ( Eric Brown ) . They have sex ... but it 's all tied into some stupid plot or something. < br / > < br / > Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever . Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation ? I suppose it 's OK cause it 's a teenage boy -- if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would ( rightfully ) be outrage . Sorry , but having it done to a boy does n't excuse it . It 's still sick . I realize Brown was of age ( he was actually 18 when this was made ) but he LOOKS 15 . I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK. < br / > < br / > Plot aside the acting sucks ( Kristel is beautiful -- but ca n't act ; Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I 've ever seen ) and the constant nudity gets boring and is n't even remotely erotic. < br / > < br / > I saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 . I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin ( who could easily pass for 18 ) . HE wanted to see it -- I did n't but I decideD what the heck ? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage . My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through ! Let me make this clear -- three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity ! That should give you an idea of how bad this is . I 'm surprised this was ever released . A 1 all the way .",0,negative
"`` I saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in Nürnberg , and it was superb . I do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film , but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic Nibelungen saga. < br / > < br / > If you are interested in silent films or in the Nibelungenlied , I highly recommend this film . The costumes were fantastic and creative , the sets were opulent and exotic , and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking ( as is typical of silent film `` '' tragedies '' '' ) Unfortunately , I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried . The story of this second film begins after Siegfried 's death , when Kremhild ( Gudrun in the Norse versions of the story ) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers. < br / > < br / > Also , I watched this film in German ; I am a native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge . It was difficult to read the ? subtitles ( what do you call that in silent films ? ) at first because of the old style German script , so I advise that if you watch it in German that you make sure you can differentiate your `` '' k 's '' '' , `` '' f 's '' '' , and `` '' s 's '' '' in the old script . : ) ''",1,positive

I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write .

"FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder .

We meet the unforgetable Robbie , the mysterious Dr Morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died out overnight . Or did they ? < br / > < br / > You can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron ` s electronic music adds even more atmosphere < br / > < br / > I ` m shocked this film isn ` t in the top 250 IMDB films .",1,positive
"I do n't watch much porn , but I love porn stars . And I love gory movies . So when I heard about a porn-star gore movie , I was really excited . Of course , that was years ago and when I heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie , I never thought I 'd actually get to see it . But I did and I 'm not ashamed to admit I loved it , even with all its flaws. < br / > < br / > First , the flaws . The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain , but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland . So why not just set it there and skip the third-grade report about Samhain/Irish immigrants/Halloween ? Also , it breaks its own rules by stating that you 're safe on the trails , but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere . It 's never clear how many cannibals we 're dealing with . There 's a big stone castle that 's obviously ancient , yet no one 's noticed it before . The self-conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters . The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she NEVER MET . The ending makes no sense. < br / > < br / > So what works ? The gore ! Sure I would have liked more , but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that was n't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie . Two murders are waay over the top and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene . The two wild murders are even given extended shots on the DVD . I 've always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and Evil Breed reinforced that .",1,positive
"`` I began watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon , thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick .

It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. < br / > < br / > The cast is excellent , including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson , Edward Herrmann , Robert Guillaume , and Robert Loggia . Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA , and Frasier 's Jane Leeves is also very good . < br / > < br / > The dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout .

If you like the whole we 've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick . I personally think that storyline has been done WAY too much , but The Sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the Secret Service .

"`` 90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill ... Mindy prances at the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of `` '' shepherd 's bread , '' '' Mindy nearly gets gang-raped ... Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure did n't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2 ) After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend `` '' Pan '' '' is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road .

I 've seen the original English version on video . Disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . The animation quality is excellent ! If you 've seen Disney 's job of Kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) Finally Miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! I ca n't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa !,1,positive
"`` Writer/director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film , `` '' Panic , '' '' from the year 2000 , and that includes his choice of cast : William H. Macy , Tracy Ullman , John Ritter , Neve Campbell , Donald Sutherland , Barbara Bain , David Dorfman . Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles , and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. < br / > < br / > '' '' Panic '' '' is the story of a hit man , Alex ( Macy ) who actually works for his father ( Sutherland ) . He covers his true profession by doing mail order work ; by all appearances , he and his wife ( Ullman ) and their son Sammy ( Dorfman ) are a typical suburban family . Unhappy with his life , Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ( Ritter ) , telling only his mother ( Bain ) . In the waiting room , he meets a young woman ( Campbell ) to whom he is immediately attracted , which complicates his situation further . His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist . When Alex receives his next assignment , he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. < br / > < br / > This is a profound story of a gentle , good man made into a killer by a monster of a father , with his mother 's knowledge , who kills to please his father but also ca n't stand up to him and quit . His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it 's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression . When it 's time for `` '' Panic '' '' to moves , it does - quickly. < br / > < br / > '' '' Panic '' '' does n't seem panicked at all . In fact , it moves very slowly . But it moves slowly not because it 's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate , mirroring Alex 's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog . By making a decision about Sara , the Campbell character , and by seeing his mark , his own psychiatrist , as a living , breathing human being , Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they do n't jive . And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche , Sammy's. < br / > < br / > William Macy gives another brilliant performance , as a loving father , a distant husband , and a cold killer , the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires , a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated. < br / > < br / > This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater . It 's too adult , too small , too subtle , too character-driven , and too good . ''",1,positive
"Reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high : a big budget , tons of popular faces , a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves . The end result is a disaster . Alice Tremblay 's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it 's audience ( I did n't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation ) , going through it 's page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark , not a sign of the magic it wished it had . The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly could n't seem that great an idea on the set , let alone on paper . ' L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay ' is a collage of comic sketches , linked together with a ( very ) thin layer of good ideas . Avoid or boredom will haunt you .",0,negative
