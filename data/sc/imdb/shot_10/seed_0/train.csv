"This film is amazing - it 's just like a nightmare . The bizarre story , the dark decors , the swarming insects everywhere , the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great ! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic . It seems a little to the films of David Lynch : the strange story , the bizarre dreams , the red curtains . Nuit Noire contains almost no plot . It 's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings , nightmares and meetings . That 's a drawback . If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement , I would give it a 10 out of 10 . But that 's missing , and that 's why I gave the movie an 8 . Nuit Noire is a film worth watching . Search that DVD and you 'll be rewarded !",1,positive
"While the overall idea of Escape from Atlantis was intriguing , I found the film to be far less than what I had hoped for upon reading the plot summery . Perhaps I am too much of a child in the technological age : the movie was made , as it is now 2002 , an official five years ago -- after viewing fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings , and science fiction feats like Star Wars , as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as Dinotopia or Homer 's The Odyssey. < br / > < br / > My beef , basically , is that I could n't relate -- I am just about the same age of the children ( a young adult ) , and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available . But the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence . I did n't find myself saying 'ACK ! I would have done the SAME thing ! ' . It did not open the doors to my imagination . Even without comparing it to high-budget films or other TV movies , standing alone , certain aspects of the feature I found to be cliche : The character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking , seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run . Even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement : a typical set of one or the other stereotypes . There was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious , accompanied by Mr . Perfect image of combining athletics , good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude , and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days . While I know the personalities pushed the story along , I think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable -- and believable ( as far as character ) -- movie. < br / > < br / > I do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design -- that made it worth finishing to the end for me . Do n't get me wrong : all movies are worth seeing for yourself , and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many , but I think that with a little more depth to the script , and a little more ( I can not believe I am saying this ) realness I dare say Escape from Atlantis could have been magical .",0,negative

"Simple story ... why say more ? It nails it 's premise . World War 3 kills all or most of the human race and we 're viewing 2 of the survivors .

"A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak . She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released . I think that the difference did n't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo , but it does matter for a romantic comedy . We can easily understand , that is , why his character would be attracted to hers , but it 's less clear why hers would be attracted to his. < br / > < br / > Still , the movie works as a light romantic fantasy . The scene where she stares at him across the cat 's head , with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring , is true magic . It 's a little jarring , therefore , when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building , and we see the age difference very sharply . As he embraces her , she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair , but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee .",1,positive
"`` I 'll keep the review of this program as short as possible . Skip it . Low budget , not funny , lousy script . Acting not quite as bad as the writing , but still bad . That 's all you need to know , but I will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary. < br / > < br / > This is a film with three segments , each one parodying some other type of movie . A MUCH funnier film with this same exact idea is `` '' Movie Movie , '' '' with George C. Scott . Very obscure , but worth searching out . MM parodied films of the 1930 's , and did it with elegance , precision and dry wit. < br / > < br / > This movie did not . It parodies three types of films , supposedly from the late 70 's , early 80 's era , only it is parodying films I 've ( almost ) never heard of . The first is , I guess , a parody of `` '' Kramer Vs. Kramer , '' '' in a way . Peter Reigert does his best with a dirt poor script . The second is a parody , of , I do n't know what ... a Danielle Steele novel ? I mean , you might see a story like this on Lifetime TV , but in a movie theater ? I mean , I remember the 70 's , I was there . This is a soap-opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power . These type of things usually parody themselves , so I do n't see how this was even necessary. < br / > < br / > We are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment , `` '' The Municipalians , '' '' which parodies cop movies . I noted elements of `` '' The New Centurians '' '' and some `` '' Dirty Harry '' '' , both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created . Yeah , nice and current . Robby Benson plays the idealistic young rookie ( over-the-top wimpy ) while Richard Widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car ( OH ! Stop ! My sides ! He 's actually drinking booze in the Police car ! How irreverent ! ) Note that this was the first film after `` '' Animal House '' '' to have the `` '' National Lampoon '' '' name attached . Wow . To go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking . I could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting-edge and original voices in American humor ( that would be National Lampoon , the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so ) to sell out and begin a long , slow slide into a world of crap , where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low-budget `` '' comedy '' '' films for a fee . Yet another reason why capitalism ( and cocaine ) sucks so bad. < br / > < br / > Anyway , this movie is a serious time suck . Do n't waste your 90 minutes . I want mine back .

"`` A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck . `` `` Mirage '' '' is obviously inspired by Spielberg 's `` '' Duel '' '' and Craven 's `` '' The Hills Have Eyes '' '' .Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The film 's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak , but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall , if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10 .

"`` Fox 's `` '' The True Story Of Jesse James '' '' ( 1957 ) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power/Henry Fonda classic `` '' Jesse James '' '' . I 'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters , the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it. < br / > < br / > In the late thirties and forties Tyrone Power was Fox 's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head Darryl Zanuck started to groom newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place . This was a major error on Zanuck 's part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement . With the possible exceptions of `` '' Broken Lance '' '' ( 1954 ) and `` '' Between Heaven & Hell '' '' ( 1956 ) it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything ! Also , Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagner 's Jesse in `` '' The True Story Of Jesse James '' '' . Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor 's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford 's classic `` '' The Searchers '' '' . But his playing here , along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers , is nothing short of boring . Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles . They totally miss the mark , lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original . The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner , as the Robin Hood of the American west , comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever . The supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely getting a look in as Ma James. < br / > < br / > The best aspects of this uninvolving so-so western is the wonderful Cinemascope/Colour cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer Leigh Harline !

"Over Christmas break , a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings . To make the work a bit more difficult , a murderous , Chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm , preying on the group in various violent ways. < br / > < br / > Registered as one of the 74 'video nasties ' listed by the U.K. in the 1980s , The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing . The term 'video nasty ' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore , violence , sex , etc . : All the things a horror fan dreams of . So , after hearing all of that info , I settled into Pranks ( alt . title ) expecting a sleazy slasher experience . . . and that 's what it tried to be , but failed pretty much completely . Visually , the film 's not great . The cinematography , gore ( except for a couple scenes ) , and overall direction all fail . It 's simply not enjoyable to watch . The unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason ( like the opening kill ) . There are some cool death scenes , including a pretty nice face melt ( which can be seen on the poster ) , but that 's about it for the positive . The acting is pretty bad , the story seems unimportant , the killer is n't cool or scary , and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid : it 's a bit boring . Overall , for a film done by a few UCLA film students for $ 90,000 ( which would be over double that today ) , The Dorm That Dripped Blood is n't a total mess . It has a couple good things , and is fairly watchable . . . But , as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces . . . it just can not compare . Do n't expect much , and you may at least be entertained . I hate to say it , but this is one of the few films I 've seen that would actually be better with a remake . . . and yet , they go after great works like Black Christmas . Oh well . . . < br / > < br / > Obligatory Horror Elements : < br / > < br / > - Subgenre : Slasher < br / > < br / > - Violence/Gore : There are some brutally cool kills , and the gore is okay for the most part . . . but nothing special . Also , they off-screened some of the best murders. < br / > < br / > - Sex/Nudity : There 's a little unappealing ( to me ) nudity , but not very much. < br / > < br / > - Cool Killer ( s ) : Nah . The ending monologue ( s ) of the killer made him/her pretty uncool. < br / > < br / > - Scares/Suspense : A jump scare or two , but nothing too effective. < br / > < br / > - Mystery : I suppose , yeah , but I simply did n't care enough , and it 's as obvious as the nose on the killer 's face. < br / > < br / > - - - < br / > < br / > Final verdict : 3.75/10 .

"`` In 1930 , Europe received quite a shock when Luis Bunuel 's ' L'Age Dor ' was released , causing a riot in Paris when screened there , resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years . Three years later , in 1933 , when Europe had gotten over the shock , it was once again turned on it 's ear with 'Ekstase ' , a symphony ( of sorts ) to love . The film starred a young , unknown German actress named Hedwig Kiesler , who would later change her name to Hedy Lamarr , when she moved to America to escape the madness of Adolf Hitler , as Eva , a young bride who has just married a cold , distant loveless husband ( played by Emil Jerman ) , only to discover that she has made a major mistake . One divorce later , Eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day , skinny dipping in a lake , when she discovers Adam , a handsome , young engineer ( played by Aribert Mog ) who takes a real fancy to her ( and she , him ) . After a wild night of passion , Eva 's ex-husband turns up once again , hoping to win Eva back , only to find he now has a rival . I wo n't spoil what transpires . Czech director , Gustav Machaty ( who directed the original screen version of 'Madam X ' , another parable in romantic obsession ) directs from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel , Frantisek Horky & Machaty , from the novel by Robert Horky . The film 's velvety cinematography ( which reminded me of Avant Garde photographer , Man Ray 's photos of the era , which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow , a lot ) is by Hans Androschin & Jan Stallich ) . The film 's brisk editing is by Antonin Zelenka & the films art direction , which goes for a lush , nearly Art Deco look , is by Bohumil Hes ) . If I have any quirk about this film , it is the music score , by Giuseppe Becce , which goes for an over the top , melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast ( certain themes are repeated over & over again , wearing out it 's welcome , fast -- -kind of like some of David Lean 's over use of certain musical themes , especially in 'Lawrence Of Arabia ' , and 'Dr.Zhivago ' ) . Some years back , a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material , cobbled together from various European existing prints available , restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the Vatican condemned it as `` '' decadent '' '' ( yeah , right ... like the Church never did anything wrong ) , and the Hayes office cut it to ribbons , when it was finally released in the U.S.A. in 1936 , in a `` '' Hayes Office '' '' approved cut ( likewise ) . Minimal dialog in German with English subtitles ( it was meant to be a mainly visual experience ) . Not rated , but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by Hedy Lamarr ( done tastefully , mind you ) & some suggestions of sexual content ( likewise ) that would scarcely earn it a PG-13 rating , nowadays . Worth a look if you have any interest in early European cinema , or Avant Garde/Experimental cinema ''",1,positive
"`` This film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of Hollywood is worth seeing . Just because you 've got an excellent ensemble cast does n't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp ! Think about it -- the film featured Richard Widmark , Lauren Bacall , Charles Boyer , Gloria Graham , Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and yet it still was a bad film ! The basic premise of the film is n't bad -- a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients ! Also , the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife ( Widmark and Graham ) had a lot of promise . However , the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo -- with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film . In fact , it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of `` '' General Hospital '' '' . Subtle , this film ai n't ! ! Realistic , this film ai n't ! ! < br / > < br / > While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script , but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors . For example , Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent -- especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies . Yet here , Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accent -- it just did n't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional . Also , Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place . Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre. < br / > < br / > Overall , this is a rather awful film . It is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly is n't very pretty . My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent. < br / > < br / > PS -- In a case of art imitating life , Oscar Levant played one of the patients . In real life , the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions . ''",0,negative

"`` This `` '' tragicomedy '' '' written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category . And yet , its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value . A masterpiece one should not miss to see ( preferably with subtitles , and not dubbed ) . < br / > < br / > In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade , a looming war decides the passengers ' behaviour . Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come ; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie ( real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors , but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who 's plowed the road give a real-life performance ) . < br / > < br / > The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war , an insight into nation 's collective person : everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can , hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy . Using a simple movie language , director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war ( World War I ) , but also highlights personal portraits with success : provincialism of a singer , inexperience of the newlyweds , seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son , and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. < br / > < br / > Brilliant in its narration , with memorable soundtrack ( especialy the Gispsy songs ) and adjusted atmosphere , well photographed and edited , this feature ( Sijan 's feature debut ) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s : `` '' Maratonci trce pocasni krug '' '' , `` '' Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota '' '' , and my other director 's favourite `` '' Davitelj protiv davitelja '' '' ) .

"`` As shallow as it may sound , I actually delayed my viewing of `` '' The Barbarians '' '' several times just because the VHS cover ( as well as the picture image displayed here on the website ) looks so incredibly gay ! By now I wish I had watched it earlier because the movie is n't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! It 's almost unbelievable that Ruggero Deodato , director of `` '' Cannibal Holocaust '' '' of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cash-in on the contemporary popular Sword & Sandal fantasy flicks , particularly Schwarzenegger 's Conan movies . The film opens with a terrific 'once-upon-a-time ' type of off-screen narrator , introducing us to the Ragneks . Their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . In other words , the Ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! Their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy Kadar kidnaps the Ragneks ' beautiful queen Canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . Meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twin-brothers Gore and Kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they 're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . Instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . Actually , the plot is n't half as bad as I initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers ' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy-monsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . The soundtrack and make-up effects are great and our almighty director Deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . The Barbarian Brother 's acting capacities are much better than I anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . The supportive cast is splendid as well . Eva La Rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl Cara , Virginia Bryant is indeed bewitching like Richard Lynch states on several occasions and the lovely Sheeba Alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut-shaped hair style ( I kid you not ! ) . Last but not least , `` '' The Barbarians '' '' stars everybody 's favorite Eyes in the Hills creep Michael Berryman as the appropriately named Dirtmaster . I know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the Village People , but `` '' The Barbarians '' '' really is a must-see Italian exploitation highlight .
