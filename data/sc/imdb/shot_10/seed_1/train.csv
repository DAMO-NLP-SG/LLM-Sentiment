"`` So , American Pie : Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series . Although , it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it ( ca n't that guy get better gigs ? ) . < br / > < br / > There is very little to compliment this movie on . There are n't any funny jokes . The acting is painful to watch , especially the girl with the `` '' southern '' '' accent which sounds more like a Canadian 's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word `` '' ya 'll . '' '' This movie makes me feel like such an idiot . Why did n't I apply to a college where nobody goes to class ( but everybody gets good grades ) , girls consistently take their clothes off in public , everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs , and you can ejaculate all over a girl 's family photos without her minding ? Really , this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn . Maybe for the next one , they 'll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead . I 'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stifler 's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that . ''",0,negative
"Shamefully , before I saw this film , I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. < br / > < br / > I had to do some research , in order to assure myself she was n't actually afflicted , as was her character , with ( well ? ) , what she was afflicted with . I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady . She pulled it of flawlessly. < br / > < br / > Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants , and needs , of a unique young lady , could be interpreted as tender , and romantic ? Well , they can be , when the right performers present them in the proper manner , as they did in this wonderful movie . I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie . I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth , but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie. < br / > < br / > I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did . Thank you for letting me express my opinion .",1,positive
"`` I will start this off by saying I could n't get all the way through it . I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site . I figured there was n't any way I would regret my purchase . Was I wrong or what ? Seriously now , who approved this project ? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity . That 's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad . The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam . The acting isnt much better . I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos . Yay , who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny , and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser . That 's about as much of the plot as I understood. < br / > < br / > Overall it 's the worst movie I 've ever seen . I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch . Each comes back and laughs and says `` '' Wow I didnt think I 'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ... . '' '' < br / > < br / > My response is always `` '' Well now you can '' '' < br / > < br / > ''",0,negative
"I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . This happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television . The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks , I started to get interesting . When he said his main influence was The Station Agent , a movie I 'd seen on DVD a week prior , I decided I had to go and check it out . The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . As far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .",1,positive
"This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie . Face it , you ca n't . Because that way there 's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot , have meaningless transitions , trite , unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd. < br / > < br / > I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie , really I did ; I like lots of crappy movies . But once I 've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY , DEAR LORD , WHY ? more than a few times , I really ca n't take it any more. < br / > < br / > Also , I would love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene .",0,negative
"A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . Obviously , It was first conceived into this world for the stage , but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end . Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . All in all , though , A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact .",1,positive
"... Bad at being intentionally bad ... < br / > < br / > This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen . While it 's obvious the movie is n't trying to be taken seriously ( Hopefully that their goal , anyway ... ) , the movie is still plain bad . Hell , it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted ... < br / > < br / > In short : Paint my muscle car prune colored !",0,negative
"This is a good family show with a great cast of actors . It 's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late . There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either , unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too . Anyway , Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character ( Pete Young ) a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly . Dean Cain , Christopher Lloyd , Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the rest of the main cast members , and each is terrific in their role . I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete 's sister Betsy ; she is quite a pill , but she still cares about her mom and brother , even though she hates to show it . It may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs , but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while , so check it out people -- you 'll be glad you did !",1,positive
"`` Henry , a veterinarian ( Paul Rudd ) , and his bossy fiancé , Kate ( Eva Longoria ) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception . It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy , giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation . But , horror of horrors , the `` '' angel '' '' ice sculpture , ordered by Kate , arrives without wings . In an ensuing fight with the sculptor , the heavy `` '' ice '' '' maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter . Now , one year later , Henry 's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward . Yet , the lovely medium , Ashley ( Lake Bell ) becomes interested in Henry herself , much to the chagrin of her catering partner ( Jason Biggs ) . More importantly , Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley , as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry . Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good ? This is an abysmal romantic comedy , one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen . No , its not the cast , as they try gamely to make things work . Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious . Biggs , a funny thespian , too , is totally wasted . As for Rudd , a very gifted performer ( see Anchorman , Knocked Up , or Clueless , please ) he tries hardest of all and , in truth , is the main reason to see this clunker . His charm , looks , and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable . But , nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner , absolutely nothing . So , if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy , think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one . Even were free tickets to fall into your lap , be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema . ''",0,negative
"We bought this film from a shop called Poundland . We were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film No Big Deal an remade it. < br / > < br / > We expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube . HOWEVER , this was shocking . BORING is the main word that comes to mind . The bad effects and script are n't enough to make you watch it . The main woman 's body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested . However , it just makes you wonder , did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off ? If so , I 'd have asked for a refund ! It looks like a homemade film , the shots do n't even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional . I CAN NOT believe that this is being sold as a marketable product. < br / > < br / > IT IS JUST BORING and UGLY to watch . The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it . There are no words to describe how terrible it is .",0,negative
"`` You have to see it to believe it ! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great , it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor , unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie , with people , love scenes , and so on . I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet . Finally , it has nothing to do with Al Gore 's documentary-movie `` '' An inconvenient truth '' '' mainly made of long monologues , painfully and with `` '' truths '' '' not always accurate , as many scientists have pointed already . < br / > < br / > The best thing you can do on earth is not miss Earth .

"Words can not describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . It is a series of random , unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady ( REALLY disturbing ) . The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco , the best actor in this movie . Also , it is rated NC-17 , shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .",0,negative
"`` My take on this , at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than I may actually have been , began with a head shake : `` '' Well , I ca n't summarize the plot , but it 's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man . '' '' Then , slight embarrassment , I ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down , that is , from whom Trebor unwittingly gets his new heart . It 'd been my last film in a long , long day halfway through the festival . Maybe I 'd dozed . The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming . Do n't know . Did know there was an O'Henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished . And knew it had to do with the heart , hence the quietly hilarious talent search . My plot-loss remark had more to do with intricacies of Trebor 's connections in France , his relation to the dog woman and so on , stuff I 'd been wide awake for . Denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director 's treatment. < br / > < br / > But I write these things too often from memory , especially festival films , films whose DVD I do n't have at hand ( Le Lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples . ) , and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions . Still , or already , L'Inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark-side superman , a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible , relatively soft-spoken , driven but patient , right among us . The scar , once he attains it , makes him , just visually I mean , in image , a sort of hybrid Frankenstein monster , mad doctor and creation all in one . The actual doctors are his tools . If he does n't extract and install the heart himself , it 's only because it 's not possible . He 's the force , always , the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself . What else is he ? To suggest that he 's us , the First World versus the Third , seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow First Worlders , on all of us. < br / > < br / > Denis 's camera 's eye - when it looks at things I know - goes usually where mine would , so I tend to trust her when she looks at things I do n't know . Snow trekking , too-fast bicycling , and forest darkness I 've known in small ways , but the South Seas not at all , so I made better entry into L'Intrus , both France and the crystalline isles of its finish , than into Beau Travail . L'Intrus is , for me , a very comfortable discomforting film . It 's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly , with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we 've seen the reality or not . A single image , Trebor cycling , his massive weight on the thin racing frame , the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires , the asphalt ribbon , the dark-in-bright-sun evergreens , cued me that the film would be linear , a road trip , a single will-driven thrust. < br / > < br / > Despite Trebor 's personal power , he 's a human failure . No matter who he 's with , he 's alone , though apparently he has n't always been . His body aborts life twice , first to need the new heart , then despite it . L'Intrus is tragedy . Trebor is hubris. < br / > < br / > I 'm navigating perilously the thread of what I remember . Let 's leave it at that . ''",1,positive
"`` Cashing in on the `` '' demons-meets-clergy '' '' trend of the late '60s/early '70s that most prominently included the triptych of `` '' Rosemary 's Baby , '' '' `` '' The Exorcist , '' '' and `` '' The Omen , '' '' `` '' The Sentinel '' '' is an addition that 's just as good ( albeit the most overlooked of the lot ) . In a way , it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of Polanski 's `` '' The Tenant '' '' ( which came out the same year ) for good measure . A New York model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss-coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale ; she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor ( the brilliant Burgess Meredith ) , plus the other off-center tenants . Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment , she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building . From there , director Michael Winner ( `` '' Death Wish '' '' ) kicks this supernatural thriller into gear , and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine . Aided by a brilliant ensemble cast , a subtle storyline , and excellent makeup FX by Dick Smith ( `` '' The Exorcist '' '' ) , `` '' The Sentinel '' '' is a genuinely creepy horror flick .

"`` ... not that all Disney films are garbage. < br / > < br / > Anyway , I saw `` '' Legend of Boggy Creek '' '' first and absolutely loved the film . When I heard it had 2 sequels , I was ecstatic . I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night . I do n't see how they can make a G-rated sequel to a horror film . The original is a movie/documentary about the Fauke Monster , and can scare anyone . `` `` Return '' '' is for kids and should not be watched by anyone . I do n't remember the plot too well , as it 's been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again , but ... It 's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill Bigfoot . Three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them . A big monsoon comes through . The hunters get hurt , are saved by the kids . Then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm . Then all of a sudden , Bigfoot comes and does something really sick . I do n't wan na ruin the ending for any of yas , but it 's not scary . Well ... . ''",0,negative
"I LOVE the Doodlebops . My son has been watching them for over a year . We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday ( connecticut ) . He LOVES them . The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares ? are you being serious ? the TV is n't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet . the parents should . Get over it . The Doodlebops actually CAN sing . Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT lip sing . Imagine , they dance , jump around and STILL sing . they have talent , the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show . This show is by far the best show on TV for kids . AND a rock band for children . How amazing is that ? Why are people saying Chad ( rooney ) is gay ? where did you hear that from ? Whether he is or not , He is awesome ! Leave him alone . Its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children !",1,positive
"I 'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess . I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks . The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame . Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes , play as if some college kid wrote this . I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes . The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about . The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in . This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation . I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker . I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move . He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls . Shock movies do not an Oscar make .",0,negative
"`` When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee , I made sure to see it . This Taiwanese director burst into fame with `` '' The Wedding Banquet '' '' and `` '' Eat Drink Man Woman '' '' a few years ago and then moved on to `` '' Sense and Sensibility '' '' and `` '' The Ice Storm '' '' . Now , he turns his attention to another American icon -- the Civil War. < br / > < br / > This story takes place in Missouri , a Union state with Southern sympathies . These never officially joined the Confederate army . Instead , they formed outlaw bands , called `` '' bushwhackers '' '' , grew they hair long , and sometimes would confiscated Union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing. < br / > < br / > The movie depicts their moral dilemma , the high drama of the times , and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the Union . There are no stars in this movie , unless you consider `` '' Jewel '' '' the singer , well cast as a young confederate widow as a star. < br / > < br / > Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the Germans were supposed Union sympathizers . This young man is an excellent actor , full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he 's exposed to the horror of war. < br / > < br / > Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom . He gives a fine and understated performance. < br / > < br / > Some of the acting , however , is wooden , especially in the long conversations they have about morality . And their costumes are too new . And the `` '' southern gentleman '' '' theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women 's arms , then burn down the stores and houses. < br / > < br / > While I do n't think that this will go down as one of Lee Ang 's `` '' great '' '' movies , I did find myself fascinated by it , in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes . I was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history. < br / > < br / > Not as much action as the usual war movie , but yet still recommended -- especially for Civil War buffs. < br / > < br / > ''",1,positive

Some scary/horror movies just fail to break the mold of the `` '' lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies '' '' cliché . This one , sadly , was no different , and like all scary movies , once you venture down that road there is no going back. < br / > < br / > And the ending ? How do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie , but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and can not do the job in the end ?
