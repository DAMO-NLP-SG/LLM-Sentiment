6868,"`` Jack and Kate meet the physician Daniel Farady first and then the psychics Miles Straume and they demonstrate that have not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors . Locke and his group find the anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis , and Ben Linus shoots her . Meanwhile , the group of Jack finds the pilot Frank Lapidus , who landed the helicopter with minor damages that can be repaired . Jack forces Miles to tell the real intention why they have come to the island. < br / > < br / > The second episode of the Fourth Season returns to the island , with four new characters , stops the confusing `` '' flash-forwards '' '' and it seems that will finally be the beginning of the explanations that I ( and most of the fans and viewers ) expect to be provided in `` '' Lost '' '' . Why the interest of the government in Ben Linus , and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that I expect to see in the next episodes . My vote is eight. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available ''",1,positive
24016,"`` After watching this film , I thought to myself , they really glossed up Errol Flynn 's life ! The movie is really nice eye candy . They really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of Hollywood just right . The costumes were great . All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair. < br / > < br / > Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn 's life ? Nah ! It 's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life. < br / > < br / > Why am I critiquing this film ? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver . Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn . He was not as good looking as the original , but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously , but as a man who , although gifted with great talent , was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside . Flynn 's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages . He also lost a lot of good friends during his life . He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland . The last scene of the film showed Errol kind of begging for Olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away . He is shown in his tux , looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool . It was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle. < br / > < br / > This film could 've had much more depth , could 've been better well-written . Sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed Errol Flynn 's human center . Surprisingly , Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn even though the film writing did n't put any depth there. < br / > < br / > I 'll probably never see this film again but I can still remember after viewing this film , `` '' Gosh , this could 've been so much more ... .. ! '' '' I give this film a D+ . ''",0,negative
9668,"It is movie about love , violence , illegal affairs and romanian tycoons . A romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern European audiences that HAVE LONG forgotten about the conservative comunist regim over film-making. < br / > < br / > A film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on . < br / > < br / > A story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood . Two young men do illegal car races . They work together as a team and prosper from their occupation , but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very tensionated movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that. < br / > < br / > Brilliant acting both by Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director Radu Muntean also give a unique charm to Furia . All this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the filmlovers around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race , language we speak or country . It is a real hope for the Romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema. < br / > < br / > I hope you enjoy watching it as I 'm sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it .",1,positive
13640,"`` Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70 's . There 's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now. < br / > < br / > The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice . She was a Ford model and it shows . She 's got classic , WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl . So what the hell is she doing in this cheap , cheesy skin flick ? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie ( which might explain it ) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part . When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she 's flippin ' Julie Andrews or something . I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gon na be her big break or something , instead of the near career killer that it was . Anyway , she is damn cute and you kind of ca n't believe she would even get naked on screen , much less do a masturbation scene , a couple of oral sex scenes ( with men and women ) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film ( snark ) . It is also definitely not a body double at all . That is our little Kristine taking one for the team , or for the greater glory of showbiz or something . It 's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ( ahem ) but in a way I kinda wish she had n't done it . That was a very pretty , talented young girl getting some really bad advice. < br / > < br / > Anyway , my guess is that Kristine Debell , wherever she is , has long , long since wished this movie would go away . She was very cute and appealing in `` '' Meatballs . '' '' Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is . ''",0,negative
14018,"`` Not since `` '' 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag '' '' and the `` '' How High '' '' previews < br / > < br / > have I laughed so little at something that the film makers thought < br / > < br / > would be hysterical. < br / > < br / > Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world . He is rejected as 4-F < br / > < br / > by the army , and decides to use his money to raise his own army- < br / > < br / > of about half a dozen . He then impersonates a Nazi commander in < br / > < br / > Italy , and eventually tries to kill Hitler . That is the description of the < br / > < br / > flimsy plot. < br / > < br / > This film is as funny as a heart attack . This film makes `` '' Hogan 's < br / > < br / > Heroes '' '' look like Shakespeare . If the money men of `` '' The < br / > < br / > Producers '' '' had really wanted to lose their cash , they should have < br / > < br / > shown this film . I can not stress how bad this thing is. < br / > < br / > Lewis ' direction consists of two different cameras shooting the < br / > < br / > action from two different angles , then being edited together . This < br / > < br / > sitcom type of direction works on television , but here it is an < br / > < br / > obvious attempt to cheat the audience . He ends most of his < br / > < br / > scenes with a still shot , as if giving the viewer a chance to double < br / > < br / > over in stitches before going to the next tired set up . I spent most of < br / > < br / > the movie doubled over in abdominal agony , accompanied with < br / > < br / > severe flatulence , over this thing. < br / > < br / > Lewis , the director and producer , sets the film in 1943 , but makes < br / > < br / > no attempt to use period costumes or sets . Everyone wears the < br / > < br / > latest style and has the latest interior design ... for 1970 . The < br / > < br / > supporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on his patented tangents , < br / > < br / > which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to < br / > < br / > watch . When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander , he spends the < br / > < br / > last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a < br / > < br / > performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring < br / > < br / > in at the beginning. < br / > < br / > The final embarassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to < br / > < br / > put one over on the Japanese . They wear buck teeth , squint their < br / > < br / > eyes , and talk in a `` '' funny '' '' accent . It may be one of the most < br / > < br / > blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps . I was < br / > < br / > slack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing , but that put < br / > < br / > me over the edge . Watch for Kaye Ballard 's very tasteless scene < br / > < br / > where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again. < br / > < br / > '' '' Star Trek '' '' 's George Takei has two small scenes , then wisely < br / > < br / > drops out of the picture . This has less laughs than Mel Brooks ' last < br / > < br / > three films combined . There is nothing sadder than watching a < br / > < br / > formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly , you < br / > < br / > actually feel ashamed for them . Jim Carrey learned that with `` '' The < br / > < br / > Majestic , '' '' but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a < br / > < br / > while pulling the same unfunny schtick . I feel sorry for him. < br / > < br / > '' '' Which Way to the Front ? '' '' is cheap , unfunny , offensive , and stupid. < br / > < br / > I feel bad for everyone involved , and anyone who must endure this. < br / > < br / > I do not recommend it. < br / > < br / > Though rated ( G ) , this contains some physical violence , some gun < br / > < br / > violence , and some adult situations .

3386,"For me , North and South ( Books I & II ) is the ultimate TV series of the 80 's . Just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.Gene Kelly , James Stewart , Elisabeth Taylor , Olivia De Havilland , Robert Mitchum , even Johny Cash¡ No series has come close to this achievement.Have you ever seen anyone looking like Lincoln ? Dick Smith 's prosthetics made Hal Holbrock 's powerful performance even more so . The crafted costumes , the jaw dropping locations , everything . It 's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright TV series ( Desperate Housewives , Lost,24 ) but North & South was , and still is , one of its kind . Do n't miss it . Only David Carradine 's portrayal of the ultimate villain ( you may call him just violent husband ) worths the viewing . Maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped , I admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them . I 'm so glad that finally is available on DVD in Spain .",1,positive

8614,"It would seem we should acknowledge Scandinavian cinema for more than merely the Dogma 1995 movement as cooked up by the Danish all those years ago . Den Brysomme Mannen , or The Bothersome Man in English , is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface . As a film alone , it is a scathing comedy on society and attitudes in the post-modern world we live in ; a world that judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like . But along with this black comedy feel to it , it would seem the film delves a little deeper and raises issues , at least to me , of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to uncover the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us. < br / > < br / > This was , in truth , a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me . The film very much falls into that category of the European art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity shrouded atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that may mean one thing or another . So many times we 've seen films that use the set up The Bothersome Man adopts and so many times it 's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist , named Andreas ( Fausa Aurvaag ) , to explore who he is ; where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are. < br / > < br / > The set up I 'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this . I 'll jump right in and say it 's in my opinion he 's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory , as have all the city 's inhabitants . Everybody in the city that Andreas mixes with are of the same age ; same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion , feeling , colour or most importantly , pain . < br / > < br / > When we first see Andreas , he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities , and approaches a petrol station in the middle of rural nowhere . He is scruffy and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite , sporting a suit and tie ; clean shaven face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best transforming shifts between the rural and the urban that I 've ever seen . But the new job as well as the new city is uneasy ; you can take breaks whenever you like ; bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything . These ideas are best put across in a cinema when Andreas , still a relative newbie to the city , is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style . There is also the initial example when one man has jumped from a window and lies impaled on some spikes but everybody walks on by without fuss. < br / > < br / > To back up my idea on everyone already being dead and the city acting as a sort of purgatory , death and harm in general is impossible . There is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone 's thumb , but everyone 's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour . Similarly , a suicide attempt involving trains later on comes to nothing and instead we get the point of view regarding what it 's like to be dragged down tube tracks with invulnerability on your side . The city acts as a barrier , a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-harm oneself is impossible ; a place in which sexual relations can occur and break-ups equally so but both under emotion-less and passion-less circumstances ; a place in which people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die . The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in 'real life ' and thus , the film says you can not kill yourself twice , indeed you can not feel pain or emotion in an afterlife of purgatory. < br / > < br / > But the film 's best part is the one that sneaks up on you . Judging by the closing five minutes of the film and the side-story that opens up involving some music coming from another man 's house , it would seem there is a fine line between the spaces the film dictates as 'heaven ' and 'hell ' . We get to see these spaces only very , very briefly  so briefly that they consist of a single shot . The 'heaven ' is a colourful kitchen with music and children playing : it offers life , hope , emotion and happiness whereas the hell is a snowy nowhere which haunts you thanks to its hopeless build up and eerie cut off point . The introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and co. faced : purgatory and everything that came with it , the afterlife just was not ready for Andreas and his freethinking , adventurous mind  and look where the thinkers end up .",1,positive

The bones of a good movie are here , and the directing from Shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out , but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established . Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the renegade Vulcan with msyterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes , particularly for Deforest Kelley who shines as 'Bones ' McCoy in this his second last movie . However , as good as those scenes are , they ultimately do not advance the plot , and end up feeling as more of a distraction . A great score from the ever reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot , and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies . All in all , a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver , has its moments . Watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene ...",0,negative

423,"I am a film directors nightmare ... especially of the mega buck , multiplex variety . While not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker 's vision , if I can find it . That 's why a gem such as 'You Are Alone ' is such an exhilarating find . The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go . Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. < br / > < br / > Spoiler below < br / > < br / > I bought the DVD version and have shared it with several people . The reactions have been varied , from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating . As a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker . This film took the later route for me and by the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne 's horror and pain at her role in Buddy 's demise . My reaction to this film reminded me of watching 'The Cook , the Thief , His Wife and Her Lover ' by Peter Greenaway many , many years ago . By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too . I 've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated . I am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies , 'Galactic Gigolo ' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos ' and a mixed bag 'The Kiss ' which I recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and does n't really represent the directors vision . Too bad , because I loved the prior two films and even found 'The Kiss ' interesting but wish 'The Kiss ' was available in a director 's cut with all of the original vision and music in tact . I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage .",1,positive

22163,"I do n't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about , the main thing you 'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production . The acting is what you 'd get if you chose people at random off the street . The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear , while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud . Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree , with dialog taking a distant back seat . The theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released , as large portions of the film do n't have any music at all . Camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess , with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better , cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way , absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene , they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand . If the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone 's heads , well , so be it . Editing is just a butcher job ; Everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible , nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word . I do n't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder , I tend to think it was the latter . < br / > < br / > I only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before I turned it off , I just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production I could n't take it anymore .

Do n't look too closely when he changes into his costume . It is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial ( can you say flabby ? ) .

The villain is rather bland and although he uses an alias ( The Scarab ) , he does n't wear a disguise of any kind . The story is repetitive and very simple .

7946,"`` Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.Not only scary , for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.The mob goon played by John Larch was terrifying.The only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a `` '' little n -- -- - kid '' '' .Those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on TV , maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.Accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the South and still till today the closest I 've come to visiting a southern city is El Paso.That stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.When the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.With the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.The film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.The terror in the movie is n't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.Re killing of little girl : The recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.When this movie came out the only school I had ever gone to was attended by mostly African-Americans.The victim looked like a girl in my class , it was like seeing an actual killing.It made a horrible scene that much worse.Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me .

Kane is no longer even the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories , but rather a formerly bad guy who is trying to save his soul ( this part is in the opening scene ) . < br / > < br / > With the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored , the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply perplexing . Is it just so they can say `` '' From the creator of Conan '' '' and hope to plug into a budding franchise if the new `` '' Conan '' '' movie gets off the ground ? Ignoring the complete departure from the stories , the movie is competent if utterly generic for the first half but then devolves into sheer stupidity in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies ( think three `` '' boss levels '' '' at the same time ) , none of whom is the least bit interesting or menacing. < br / > < br / > If I was n't a Kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material , I 'd probably give the film a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 .

3352,"`` This thing works on all levels -- it 's intense as a thriller , full of Lars von Trier homages , but also very much its own film -- and it does have a message : happiness comes from within , best personified in the wounded soldier who practically ( and , believe it or not , humorously ) disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film , all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them . You laugh at him , but you envy him as well . The central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin just after World War II . He ties the parallel stories together , and really screws people up in the process . To say things go wrong is an understatement -- and structurally , the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other . It 's like every one of them has an opposite -- just so tight , like watching anti-matter collide . You will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at . To say more would qualify as a spoiler -- all I can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the US , not even on DVD . Some moron probably told them Americans would n't get it -- which is crap , because we not only `` '' get '' '' but produce things like South Park ... If this film gets marketed in the US , it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy , because that 's what it is . Over-the-top , sick and twisted , but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy ! ''",1,positive
15191,"`` Reports of this film 's brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated , and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie , I fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull , unscary , uncreepy , overlong , and at times , unbearably irritating . I 'm not some schlocky horror fanatic . I love j-horrors and euro-horrors over American horrors any day , but I feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in it. < br / > < br / > It could have been so great . A reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences , which seem ostensibly unlinked , but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them - dead pigeons , thudding noises , the presence of strangely tied knots ... Our reporter goes from person to person , interviewing them , filming them and then passing on . Three important characters are among this jumble of people , a young , shy psychic girl , an immensely irritating , insane psychic man , and a crazy old woman and her boy , whose importance is not revealed until later on. < br / > < br / > The problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting , which makes its two hour running time unforgivable . It 's also not even remotely scary or creepy . Supposedly scary scenes , like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly , shown twice , or worse , we are told when they are about to happen . Other techniques , such as telling us that a family just interviewed `` '' died five days later '' '' simply do n't make me care , let alone mildly creeped. < br / > < br / > The film does pick up a bit towards the end , as our reporter , cameraman , psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to 'remove ' the curse which is linking all these deaths . However , by that time , I was in a state of catatonic boredom , and could n't care less , so all the fairly creepy camera-work and shocks were wasted on me . The `` '' final tape '' '' is quite good , but once again , I 'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end. < br / > < br / > Boring and dull , not scary and not creepy , I would advise you keep away from Noroi .

15694,"`` Usually , I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the film I 'm reviewing . With this , I simply can not explain . I needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a film that I did n't know anything about . But something kept me glued to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle . Oh , that 's right . Boredom. < br / > < br / > Graham plays Joline , a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married ( played by Luke Wilson ) . When her hubby decides to set off in search of better things ( work , women and scripts , presumably ) , Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his `` '' spiritual wheelchair '' '' . It sounds like I 'm making this up but sadly , I 'm not . In reality , this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a work-out . Oh and Goran `` '' ER '' '' Visnjic is in there as well , for some reason. < br / > < br / > The TV schedules had this down as a comedy but I failed to find a single laugh anywhere . It struck me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger ( the director and writer ) , in the same mould as `` '' Girl , Interrupted '' '' but even that had more laughs than this . Graham 's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and I felt sorry for the hen-pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife . Very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around , waiting for Graham to turn up like the extras in `` '' The Truman Show '' '' . In fact , the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings was `` '' Heather Graham - nice baps '' '' . And that was n't because I was too tired to enjoy the film. < br / > < br / > In truth , it 's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to . Graham purists ( a VERY small number of overall movie-goers , I think you 'll agree ) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect American Indian dream-catchers will take something from this . I was amazed that the average rating ( at time of writing ) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as `` '' Die Another Day '' '' and `` '' Gothika '' '' in my book and that simply ai n't right . `` `` Committed '' '' is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens .

I am very forgiving of the horror genre . One of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film `` '' Ed Wood '' '' where Ed Wood ( Johnny Depp ) freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on `` '' Plan 9 's '' '' cheap sets and continuity problems , `` '' You do n't know anything ! Have n't you ever heard of 'suspension of disbelief ? ! ' '' '' Well , I try to bring that `` '' suspension of disbelief '' '' philosophy with me to every horror film I see and it usually works .

And , that 's bad. < br / > < br / > Strike Two : < br / > < br / > Jim Wynorski . This `` '' filmmaker '' '' probably fancies himself a chip off the ol ' Corman , but nothing could be further from the truth . Roger Corman shot fast , furious and under budget , but was able to deliver a tight original film . Though Wynorski delivers a cheap film , he cheats his viewers ( and perhaps other artists ) as he steals entire pieces of James Horner 's `` '' Humanoids From The Deep '' '' and `` '' Battle Beyond The Stars '' '' musical scores and inappropriately drops them into Cheerleader Massacre . On the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to , Dan Savio ( an extra in Wynorski 's `` '' Deathstalker II '' '' ) . You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and back again as Wynorski lifts entire scenes from both `` '' Slumber Party Massacre '' '' and `` '' Humanoids From the Deep .

8504,"`` `` '' Empire Strikes Back '' '' director Irvin Kershner 's `` '' Never Say Never Again , '' '' a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie `` '' Thunderball , '' '' does n't surpasses the Terence Young original , but this non-Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado . Nevertheless , despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' rates as an above-average , suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including Sean Connery , Kim Basinger , Klaus Maria Brandauer , Max Von Sydow , Barbara Carrera , Edward Fox , Bernie Casey , Alec McCowen , and Rowan Atkinson . The film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes . Unlike the franchise James Bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget . Indeed , the film features only three gadgets : an explosive ball-point pen , a wristwatch with a laser , and a souped-up motorcycle . Aside from the flavorful Lani Hall opening theme song , `` '' Ice Station Zebra '' '' composer Michel Legrand 's orchestral music score leaves much to be desired . Legrand replicates none of those snappy , jazz cues that made John Barry 's music for the regular Bond franchise so memorable . All in all , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' seems to fit more into the first two Bond movies '' '' Dr. No '' '' and `` '' From Russia With Love '' '' and `` '' On Her Majesty 's Secret Service '' '' in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter. < br / > < br / > '' '' Never Say Never Again '' '' presents Sean Connery 's James Bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach . Ironically , Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore 's Bond movies treated 007 as an active , young guy . Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple screenplay that emphasize Bond 's age . Initially , Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece , but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and Connery sports a hairpiece . He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into `` '' Diamonds Are Forever '' '' at the last moment to replace John Gavin . Connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for `` '' Diamonds Are Forever . '' '' At 52 , Connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script. < br / > < br / > The action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island . He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman , only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he is n't looking . It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M ( Edward Fox of `` '' Day of the Jackal '' '' ) to test Bond 's ability . The new M does n't share his predecessor 's use of field agents . M decides that Bond needs to clean out his system of all 'free radicals ' and has 007 packed off to Shrublands . While at the country clinic , Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them . The nurse is none other than SPECTRE assassin Fatima Blush ( Barbara Carrera of `` '' The Island of Dr. Moreau '' '' ) and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees USAF officer Jack Petachi ( Gavan O'Herlihy of `` '' Superman 3 '' '' ) . Petachi is part of a SPECTRE plan by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo ( Klaus Maria Brandauer of `` '' Out of Africa '' '' ) to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads . The villains implant a duplicate eyeball into Captain Petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons . After he steals the weapons for SPECTRE , Fatima Blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up . Indeed , the first part of `` '' Never Say Never Again , '' '' apart from the SPECTRE planning conference , belong to Fatima as she supervises Petachi 's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond , one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device. < br / > < br / > Eventually , Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino ( Kim Basinger of `` '' Mother Lode '' '' ) and sneaks into Largo 's charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called 'Domination ' to see who will rule the world . Bond bests him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems to be able to remove . Bond and Fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up . Their earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame . Like in the original `` '' Thunderball , '' '' the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea , but just the warheads themselves. < br / > < br / > Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison , Nigel Small-Fawcett ( no lesser than Rowan Atkinson of `` '' Mr. Bean '' '' fame , who is worried that Bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise . Of course , Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the film 's source of comic relief . The C.I.A . sends Felix Leiter ( Bernie Casey of `` '' Guns of the Magnificent Seven '' '' ) to back up Bond . This is the first time that an African-American portrayed Leiter . Bond encounters his share of problems , involving saving Domino from Arab slavers , while Leiter and he save the world . `` `` Never Say Never Again '' '' is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many neat touches , but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise Bond films have . Indeed , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theatre take on 007 . ''",1,positive
18724,"Pepe le Moko , played by Charles Boyer , is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe , and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah , a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go , until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all . For le Moko , although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody , it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he ca n't leave , because the moment he does , he knows he 'll be arrested. < br / > < br / > Boyer 's performance was good , and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar . He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time . The movie itself , unfortunately , was quite a letdown . A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent , of which I 'll mention two . First was the idea that the police would n't enter the Casbah . That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander , and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly . So , neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police would n't enter , nor the statement by Inspector Slimane ( also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia ) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense . I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby ( Hedy Lamarr ) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her , essentially giving himself up . I understand the irony of the final few scenes , of course , as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison ( the Casbah ) only to find real freedom in his capture ( because he 's shot and killed by the police . ) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap. < br / > < br / > This is worth watching for Boyer , and to a lesser extent Calleia , but the story is disappointing and inconsistent . 3/10",0,negative

For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed , and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver 's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver. < br / > < br / > The scenes involving this carriage ( the film was known as `` '' The Phantom Carriage '' '' or `` '' The Phantom Chariot '' '' in English-speaking countries ) are eerie and mesmerizing , utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today . Most strikingly , the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned . As fascinating as these scenes are , however , the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm , played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life . In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife , children and brother , and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy . Abruptly , without segue or explanation , we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck , in trouble with the law and alienated from his family . Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a story-telling deficiency , but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar , sordid details on our own . It 's suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges , the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage , but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause , a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform. < br / > < br / > While David Holm is our central figure the story 's true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior . When the nurse herself is dying -- indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm 's behalf -- she demands to see him , and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery. < br / > < br / > At times this film resembles Dickens ' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life , suffer over his misbehavior , and reform . I was also reminded of Sjöström 's 1917 drama `` '' Terje Vigen , '' '' in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone ( a sequence echoed here ) . The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore , found earlier in his `` '' Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru '' '' ( a.k.a . `` `` The Outlaw and His Wife , '' '' 1918 ) that no man can outrun his fate . This time , however , it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate , for he 's given an unexpected second chance to make amends. < br / > < br / > Viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title , but may not be prepared for this film 's painful examination of a troubled man 's alcoholic downfall . But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate `` '' Körkarlen '' '' in its entirety . It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sjöström 's most accomplished works . ''",1,positive
20198,"`` This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen , and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst . The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol , and then obviously it goes to animated story itself . You probably already know it , Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas . He is visited by Jacob Marley ( Nicolas Cage ) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past ( Jane Horrocks ) , Present ( Sir Michael Gambon ) and the silent Future/Yet To Come . After all this he obviously realises the true magic of Christmas , and promises to be nicer in future . The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends ( a stupid idea ) , Scrooge 's ex-love Belle ( Kate Winslet ) needing to see him to help at the orphanage , the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids , `` '' want '' '' and `` '' ignorance '' '' , Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice , and he 's worried he ca n't keep his promise to stay nice . Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit , Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit , Iain Jones as Scrooge 's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig . The animation is not great quality , the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage . The only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet , singing the closing song `` '' What If '' '' , as for the rest , it is just excruciatingly awful . Very poor !

Still , the movie is FUN . it 's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time . Sure it depends on one 's sense of humor , however I 'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it . Please note : the movie lasts for about an hour , and I think it 's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest . < br / > < br / > There 's also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties , when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment . I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved , due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows ( movies like this are special alright ) , and very often receive a standing ovation .",0,negative

Humour was the soldiers ' key to survival , and it was great to see a mini-series about war actually have some sort of humour in it , which is usually difficult to do without offending people . From what I 've read about soldiers in Changi PoW camp , this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those Australian , British , New Zealand , American and Dutch men spent there .

No-one gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their `` '' enemies '' '' and themselves in equal measure. < br / > < br / > The interplay between the sympathetic Senator 's Aide ( played in scintillating style by Peter Sarsgaard ) and the real Washington power-mongers is electrifying . Meanwhile out in the field , new CIA man ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) goes through a sea change in his attitude to the USA 's new found cosiness with torture . Sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is , one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way ? The film has few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhaal 's flawed and vacillating CIA man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope. < br / > < br / > The sad fact of course is that this film is n't fiction at all , but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them . The awful truth is that we in the UK and USA have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go . All this in the name of freedom ! There 's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies . This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently ! ! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition , torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong-headed and stultifyingly stupid as the Jihadists and suicide bombers. < br / > < br / > All praise to the sensibilities of a talented South African director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised , and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the US and beyond . Oh , and by the way , the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise ( which I wo n't give away ) . < br / > < br / > I saw the film in an early London preview so it has not yet been widely written up but I 'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning . The BBC review has been very strongly in support and they ( and I ) suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut-outs .

I do n't mind a little humor in my Holmes ( I 'm a big fan of Billy Wilder 's `` '' The Private Life of SH '' '' ) , but this version of `` '' The Sign of Four '' '' feels like a Grand-Guignol-esque episode of `` '' Murder , She Wrote '' '' ( right from the opening credits , that are of the worst possible kind : a montage of scenes from the movie ) as directed by Mel Brooks . Ian Richardson is a fine actor , and certainly looks the part ( he 's a dead ringer to those drawings from The Strand ! ) , but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous , from the silly smile he frequently sports ( I thought the drug Holmes was into was cocaine , not weed ) to his expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences . Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man , he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him . David Healy is an unmemorable but , given the circumstances , acceptable Watson , and is not too much of a buffoon ... at least not more than the rest of characters . Cherie Lunghi ( Excalibur ) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated ingenue fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudeville. < br / > < br / > Story-wise , there are some pointless additions ( like giving Tonga vampire teeth , an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live , turning him into a reject from Island of Dr. Moreau ) , and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside Holmes , as we are well informed of everything way before Holmes finds out . And this is full of tired clichés : not only we get the infamous catchphrase `` '' Elementary , my dear Watson '' '' ( which , as any Sherlockian will know , Conan Doyle never ever wrote ) , but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having Hindi music pop out of nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindi clothes. < br / > < br / > Bottom line : In Britain , in the eighties , two rival TV companies attempted to create a long-running series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations , and produced initial TV-movies as potential pilots .

The film plods along at a fairly slow pace & director Newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing . Technically the film is n't great , obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who has n't shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth . The black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good Dr. Cameron 's laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top . The acting is stiff & wooden with Petro looking like he 's on dope throughout the entire film , Zucco as the mad scientist does n't convince & is forgettable . The Mad Monster is a pretty lame horror film , there is very little here to entertain although at least I made it through to the end in a single sitting which when I think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself !",0,negative
6549,"Extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from Vargtimmen ( ok , they have different names and initial situations , but the actors are the same ) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts . The depiction of the fighting parties as faceless , superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to Orwell 's 1984 , even if Bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war . That is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards Eva 's and Jan 's marriage are relevant and essential , while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered with lambencies before . An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions .",1,positive
5689,"... and my reasons for which are simple- there are so many great films presented and discussed here ( most of them by their own directors and stars ) , so many clips of infamous moments in 70 's movie history , and in fact a number of films I have yet to see , that it would n't be fair to grade this work . By this logic I should n't have given grades to other movie documentaries like Martin Scorsese 's Personal Journey through American Movies and My Voyage to Italy . But while those films were on the basis of one man 's view of cinema , narrating through most of the way , Richard LaGravanese and ( the late ) Ted Demmes ' A Decade Under the Influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves . < br / > < br / > What makes 'Decade ' worth at least one watch for film buffs , or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's-70 's in America , are the levels that it goes to , that in the uncut version ( three hours , not the theatrical version , which I have no comment on ) plenty of ground is covered . Interviews include the likes of Scorsese , Robert Altman , Sidney Lumet , Julie Christie , Jon Voight , Francis Ford Coppola , Paul Schrader , Pam Grier , Bruce Dern , Peter Bogdanovich , Roger Corman , Dennis Hopper , Robert Towne , etc , and there 's a constant flow of insight from start to finish . The way the clips and directors/actors pop up , edited together in a flashy and quick style , is also fascinating . < br / > < br / > The one down comment I have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books , like Easy Riders , Raging Bulls , and though I have n't seen the movie version of that book yet I 'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here ( in fact , the book of that is one of the best I 've ever read . HOWEVER , this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future- they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as Easy Rider , The Last Picture Show , Annie Hall , Coming Home , and lessor knowns like Scarecrow , Panic in Needle Park , The Landlord , Joe , They Shoot Horses Do n't They . They can also learn about who influenced them ( new waves of Europe and Asia ) , who they served as influences for , and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd .

6515,"This movie , one of the best I 've ever seen , talks about incommunicability . It does it plunging ourselves in a livid Taipei , stained in cold colors , where the rain falls incessantly ; a DAMP world . It does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world , a man and a woman . a coincidence , or the fate , links their existences , but they 're not able to open one to the other with words . Characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships . An incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits . all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie , dialogues are nearly absent , and when some words are spoken they 're often weak and empty , far away from describing people 's real feelings . So , the progression of the story , the revelation of character 's feelings is developed ( brilliant idea ! ) by the musical digressions , only apparently meaningless , that speckle the movie . The proceeding of the sentimental event , and the drama of female protagonist , lead us to a splendid ending , heavily symbolic . A movie totally different from the usual , a clever realization by a great-talented director . PS . Forgive me for my bad grammar ! !",1,positive

Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert ; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together .

1915,"The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a lack of love . The film starts off with the main character ; Hans Epp , returning from a spell in the foreign legion . He returns to his mother , not to be told how much she loves him , or how much she 's missed him ; but to be told that he is worthless and , even worse , that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead . It is the character 's relation to women that makes this film so hateful ; the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender ; he is consistently humiliated by them , and it is through his relations with them that his life is n't as great as it could have been . This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink . He lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman , and even his wife ; a woman that is supposed to love him , never really shows any affection for him . Even at the end , his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband. < br / > < br / > The Merchant of Four Seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film . There is n't a scene in the movie where someone is happy , and not only that ; but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it 's central characters . The movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time , that 's for sure . Despite all the misery , the film never steps out the bounds of reality ; every event in this movie can - and most probably has - happened , and that only serves in making the movie more shocking . The film is , of course , helmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder ; the cult German director that committed suicide in 1982 . This is only my second taste of the man 's work , but through just two films , it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates . Both films are downtrodden and gritty - yet realistic pieces of art . His characterization in this movie is subtle ; we only ever get to know the characters through their plight 's and not through their character . This is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film , not the people themselves - and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like , it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to . < br / > < br / > The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable ; the movie is high on substance and low on style , and that makes for a very memorable picture , and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience . It is with that in my mind that I give this film my highest recommendations ; it 's not sweet and it 's not pleasant , but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression , and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you .",1,positive

I love Fred Astaire musicals , the great , great songs , & Fred 's peerless grace . But comrades , if you see idle , brainless , rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden & unemployed , that 's a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda ' . Any movie is steeped in the values of its time & place , not to mention those who fund it  the pipers who call the tune . Great art transcends all , as did 'Nevsky ' , as did 'All Quiet on the Western front ' . I confess . I saw it last 40 odd years ago . But the images are burned in my brain . It 's the greatest battle scene ever likely to be filmed . And it makes you horrified to be thrilled . 'Plastic ice ' did someone say ? That 's real death you 're watching . Real extras died making this . 'Real looking ' is now special effects-defined it seems . Likewise 'too long ' - for an age of shrunken attention spans ? Mozart had 'too many notes ' ? Propaganda , Catholic Church defamed ? The Vatican was STILL at it when they called on ancient favors to get the German Christian democrat gov . to recognize Croatia in the 1990s  remember the chaos & genocides ? Forget the props , the lighting of Nevsky painted the Medieval world  like a Breughel . There 's one in Hampton Court Palace showing a massacre . Crude Dutch nationalist propaganda maybe , but it tears at the heart . Stylized acting ? So what 's Henry V ( Olivier movie ) ? Naturalism ? Does anyone believe English medieval knight-killers talked like that ? As said , the music of Prokofiev is magnificent . Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls & genius to match sound & image at this 100 octane level . OK , you want the snaffle & bit . I 'll risk the nervy thorobred every time . Eisenstein did not copy Wehrmacht helmets , rather , his model seems to have been those buckets worn by 'Teutonic knights ' in nazi pageants of the 1930s . Eisenstein was a genius , but unlike Hollywood directors , he had near unlimited ( non-commercial ) time & funding . Modern Russian directors are free from political shackles , but have no money . Even Kurasawa had to make a late ( great ) movie in communist Russia . He was revered but unfunded in his own country ( much like Russell ) . How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder ? Imagine sane people from another , peace-loving world . How would they react to Nevsky ? Would the battle , or the grieving for the dead dominate their cognitions ? If we did n't know about the gas chambers & SS , what about 'Triumph of the Will ' ? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD , cheap ?",1,positive

The couple 's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. < br / > < br / > The ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film `` '' Poltergeist '' '' are obvious . I will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences , but it is sometimes very , very boring . The acting here is nothing special , the mood is alright , the score ( which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music ) was somewhat annoying , and the CGI special effects are really horrible .

15465,"Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team , he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies , many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features . Most of Laurel 's 'parody ' films are only mildly funny , and even less funny for modern audiences who have n't seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying . Fortunately , 'Mud and Sand ' lampoons a movie which is still well known : 'Blood and Sand ' , starring Rudolph Valentino . 'Blood and Sand ' was released only nine weeks before this parody , giving you some idea of how quickly Broncho Billy 's movies were ground out , edited and distributed. < br / > < br / > Various sources ( including IMDb ) state that Stan Laurel 's character in this film is named Rhubarb Vaselino , with a final ' o ' . I 've screened a print of 'Mud and Sand ' with the original titles ( in Hobo type font ) , so I report that Laurel 's role is actually cried Rhubarb Vaseline , with an ' e ' . But I agree that 'Vaselino ' is funnier . Laurel copies the elaborate sideburns which Valentino wore in 'Blood and Sand ' ( he should 've made them longer ! ) , and there 's a parody of Valentino 's dressing scene from that movie , which made female movie-goers swoon in 1922 . A señorita named Carmen in the original film is parodied here as Caramel ( a girl I 'd like to sink my teeth into ) . < br / > < br / > This movie ( like the original ) apparently takes place in Spain , yet there 's a Prohibition gag . Laurel uses a distinctive hat-tipping gesture here which could have become a trademark for him ( like Hardy 's distinctive necktie twiddle ) , but I 've never spotted it in any other Laurel film . There 's some amusing dialogue : Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors to 'Save a bull for me . ' When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador , a lackey tells him 'The bull is without , sir ' ... which is funny , but I was disappointed that Laurel did n't reply 'Without WHAT ? '. < br / > < br / > There 's one funny moment here which almost certainly was n't planned , when Vaseline shows up for the bullfighter auditions . Laurel swaggers into the bullring , and -- before you can say 'corrida querida ' -- he tosses a bull over the fence , where it lands with a thump near the other auditioners . The bull is obviously a fake , but the gag is funny anyway ... and , aye , there 's a title card with a joke about 'throwing the bull ' . The serendipitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag , and Vaseline slings a second bull over the fence . This one lands on its butt , and balances upright for just an instant before toppling . VERY funny ! If somebody planned that gag in this quickie comedy , I salute the unknown gagsmith ... and the tech man who rigged the bull to land in that position . More likely it happened by luck , and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it in. < br / > < br / > During the silent era , whenever Hollywood made a big-budget feature film which was set anyplace where the people do n't speak English , it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local lingo , then dissolve to a shot of the same text in English . I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here : we see a notice-board outside the corrida with a message in Spanish , then it dissolves to the same text in English . Unfortunately , the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted. < br / > < br / > The actresses in this movie are attractive ... including Broncho Billy 's wife Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel 's common-law wife Mae Dahlberg ; the latter briefly does a pretty dance . ( Mae had danced in Stan 's vaudeville act . ) I was surprised to spot Charlie Chaplin 's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a brief role , since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie . In 'Mud and Sand ' , Laurel gives a funny performance that 's quite unlike his later familiar Stanley character ... but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy . My rating : just 3 out of 10 . TRIVIA NOTE : Twenty-three years later , in Stan Laurel 's very last American film -- 'The Bullfighters ' ( 1945 ) -- he again played a Spanish bullfighter ( with his Spanish voice post-dubbed ) . Coincidentally , that film used stock footage from 'Blood and Sand ' : not Valentino 's movie , but the Tyrone Power remake . 'Mud and Sand ' is funnier than 'The Bullfighters ' , but not much .",0,negative
9994,"`` This is n't so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details , so I advise you NOT to read this review if you have n't seen the film , because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you. < br / > < br / > In a way A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original , at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from Ring or Dark Water , while the storyline itself ( especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the `` '' rubber reality '' '' aspect of the narrative ) is reminiscent of films like Fight Club ( lead character interacts with someone created in their mind ) , Mulholland Drive ( character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue ) , as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway , Jacob 's Ladder , and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness , plus Amenabar 's films ( The Others , Abre Los Ojos ) , Memento ( particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory ) , et al . Thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film 's overall emotional impact , and I personally found A Tale Of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. < br / > < br / > Many people have commented on the `` '' confusing '' '' nature of the narrative , but I personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory , even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner . The narrative only becomes confusing for some because , midway through the final third , the story switches from a purely subjective setting ( ie . Soo-Mi 's warped perception of reality ) to an objective one , with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of Soo-Mi 's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness . The shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard , but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned Mulholland Drive ( even though we 're not dealing with a character 's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which , in turn , reminded me of another Lynch movie , Lost Highway ) . To be honest , I do n't really regard A Tale Of Two Sisters as a Horror movie as such , but rather a tragic story of a family 's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character 's mental illness ( and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film ) . < br / > < br / > That aside , the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I 've seen this side of Wong Kar Wai 's 2046 . The performances are also fantastic without exception , and I expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future ; not to mention the music , but then east Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days. < br / > < br / > It 's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as `` '' yet another Asian horror film '' '' , oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach . But then each to their own .

7298,"When the long running 'Happy Ever After ' came to an end , its characters- 'Terry & June Fletcher ' were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel- 'Terry & June ' , although their surnames were changed from Fletcher to Medford. < br / > < br / > Terry has received a new job and as a result , he and June move to Purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes- unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment , the boss inviting himself to dinner and Terry trying to chance his arm at D.I.Y but cocking it up each time . A fellow IMDb user branded this show as 'not clever ' and 'never well written ' . Fair enough , it was n't clever , but that was the whole point . As for 'never well written'- some of the episodes were pretty substandard , I will admit , but overall I found it to be extremely well written , highly amusing and very well acted. < br / > < br / > It was warm hearted slapstick , not dissimilar to the later B.B.C sitcom 'Keeping Up Appearances ' . Eight different writers contributed to the nine series , giving the show plenty of scope . Terry Scott was a comic genius , as he well proved in productions such as 'Hugh & I ' , the 'Carry On ' films and of course , here ! June Whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right. < br / > < br / > I enjoy some modern shows- i.e 'Still Game ' , 'The Catherine Tate Show ' , 'Legit ' and 'Empty ' . I even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy'- 'Naked Video ' , 'The Young Ones ' and 'The Comic Strip Presents ' but I am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy , such as this . Humour that you do n't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up . For the record , 'Terry & June ' was wonderful stuff . Special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well !",1,positive

The music and cinematography is pretty good , but the special effects , at times , are terrible -- rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play !

8182,"For those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary , this is a unique film . Part homage to German expressionism , part allegory , the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920 's . Moreover , the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning . Aside from this , the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice , perception , and opinion . In truth , it 's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows . In sum , this film is something not often seen and , as the producer of the film said in the Q & A that followed , will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day .",1,positive

Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer , while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role . William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and , apparently , intercourse .

It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over . I remember Sherlock , the puppet , in the tree . The show taught us how to count , add , subtract , and the alphabet . For thirty minutes a day now , I learned something new with Paula and Janis . I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories , inexpensive props , riding the swings , and talking to puppets .

4372,"Being a seasoned fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento , Mario Bava , Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado , I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack . I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated , I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I did n't particularly like The House By the Cemetery . These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers . But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films . City of the Living Dead was a film I found very interesting but Do n't Torture a Duckling is very nearly a masterpiece. < br / > < br / > Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered . The authorities are clueless as to who 's behind these crimes , especially after their prime suspect has been cleared . An eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl ( who seduces young boys ) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it. < br / > < br / > Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast ( not always the case with 70 's Italian thrillers ) make Do n't Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller . The plot is well constructed , not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying . Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals , particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk . Fulci 's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled . When thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper it 's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point . So far I have n't seen any Fulci film made as professionally as this one. < br / > < br / > While not a traditional giallo film , Duckling has many of the genre 's trademarks . Fulci displays complete control over the format , only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment , but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics . The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch. < br / > < br / > So far Do n't Torture a Duckling is Fulci 's best film by far in my opinion . Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot .",1,positive

From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans , this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor . There is n't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who are n't old enough to remember it . The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne 's help . Other than the dust bowl scenes , the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight . Coburn 's speech comparing Naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the ( then current ) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and Varno 's Dr. Scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant Nazis justifying their actions. < br / > < br / > When viewed from a historical perspective , some aspects of TFW are interesting .

Richards is very sympathetic , with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent , not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless . Crucially she 's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical , blinkered , arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she 's merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker. < br / > < br / > The farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place ( in this instance Betty 's house ) at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here , even if the shift in tone is unfortunate. < br / > < br / > Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman both doing solid work , and it 's especially pleasing to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes. < br / > < br / > Not nearly as cruel as you might expect , and not at all mean-spirited , Nurse Betty - while far from being a laugh riot - is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress .",1,positive

5418,"THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him . This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore , but for those who do n't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now , it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world , but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood 's most powerful agents , Helen Kushnick , in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job . It 's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value , but for fans of these two late night superstars , this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television . According to this movie , Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that 's where Helen Kushnick came in . The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen 's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC 's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who , despite having Carson 's support , was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick . John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno , respectively , but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling . Bates commands the screen in one of her best , if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast . There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson , but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out .",1,positive

18972,"`` Yes , this review may contain spoilers , but you 'll thank me for it . This is the worst film I 've seen in quite some time . I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had , but inexplicably , there are several people who love this film and Spacey 's performance in particular. < br / > < br / > Some will chastise me for saying it , but I find Kevin Spacey 's acting quite limited despite the world 's admiration for him . I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin 's `` '' American Beauty '' '' role . His character in this film is ridiculously overacted , all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant. < br / > < br / > There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low . Somehow , I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny , but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button ( this is approximately 20 minutes into the film ) . < br / > < br / > What about the faux-homage to `` '' Resevoir Dogs '' '' ? Whaley proclaims , `` '' I think I saw this in a movie once , '' '' as if he 's going to cut off Spacey 's ear . But what does he use to cut him ? An envelope ! That 's right , he 's going to give him paper cuts ! That has to be one of Hollywood 's all-time worst scenes , and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. < br / > < br / > I will admit that I did n't see the end of this film ( my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end ) , but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense . Well , I do n't care what happened in the end , because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue . I even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did . ''",0,negative
1475,"`` This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during their `` '' Best of '' '' week and can also be seen on South Park 's second season DVD . I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD showing clips of this documentary , most of which occurs with Matt Stone , Trey Parker , and some other guy in a hot tub . It was funny when I saw it in the commercials , but I was used to seeing it by the time I saw the actual documentary. < br / > < br / > Overall , `` '' Goin ' Down to South Park '' '' is a fairly funny and interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and of the series ' history going back to when Matt and Trey came up with the idea in college . However , there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing . It 's not as fast-paced , rapid-fire , and as lively as the actual South Park episodes . Instead , it kind of has a slow , dry-wit style , which at times can be funny , but most of the time you 're just waiting for something to happen .

15252,"`` I 've read a lot of reviews on the IMDb ( well , all five of the ones that have been written at the time that I 'm writing this ) and I 'm surprised at the amount of praise heaped upon The Brideless Groom , which is undoubtedly one of the lesser comedies performed by the Stooges . I prefer the older ones where it was Larry , Curly and Moe , although Shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes in Sing a Song of Six Pants , another Stooges short which is only moderately amusing but far superior to Brideless Groom . Indeed , there is a single slightly amusing scene in the film , the `` '' don't-hit-a-lady '' '' scene , which is barely amusing at all and is 15 minutes into the film . Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. < br / > < br / > Shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle has passed away and left him an inheritance of $ 500,000 , provided he get married within 48 hours , which is short enough notice as it is , but by the time Shemp learns about it he has only 7 hours left . This is a premise that had been done and redone before , but was not , I do n't think , a massive cliché at the time this film was made , as it is now . There are a series of gags throughout the film , none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so widely known . It seems that the Stooges have run into the same troubles that plagued so many of Shirley Temple 's films  there is too little reliance on content and too much reliance just on the fact that they 're there. < br / > < br / > The standard characteristics of the Stooges are here , Moe is the mean one , whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film , and the slapstick sound effects ( although with more exceptions than usual ) are fairly amusing , but are plugged into their standard slots in this film . The line `` '' Hold hands , you lovebirds '' '' is immortal . The rest of the film is not. < br / > < br / > There is much talk among the other people who have reviewed this movie for this site about this being one of the best of the Stooges shorts , that you wo n't find one weak moment , about how this is their best since the early 30s shorts . It 's just not true . I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for milestone classics and for the giants of early comedy , which the Three Stooges certainly are , but that respect is damaged when poorer films are praised more than they should be . The Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it is a Stooges film , but for exactly the same reason , it should have been better . The Three Stooges were just better than this . ''",0,negative

2885,"See No Evil is the first film from WWE films . Yes WWE , Word Wrestling Entertainment , pro wrestling . Of course being that it 's a WWE film a wrestler has to star in it , the wrestler being Glenn Jacobs aka Kane . Which is not really important as if you did n't know Kane or what WWE stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling , as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling . See No Evil is gross out horror film , it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it 's just saying , hey look how gross we can get ! Not that there is anything wrong with that . Jacob Goodnight ( played by Kane ) is sort of a Jason type character , his mother tortured him as a kid with strict ( understatement ) Christian beliefs and has warped his mind . Now he 's a big scary chopping killing machine . 90 % of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where Jacob stalks six teenagers ( surprised ? ) and a handful of adults . I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh , who cares ? Despite it 's lack of originality See No Evil is well made , for what it 's supposed to be . Kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary . One flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive , I really looking forward to having them being horribly killed , but alas , does not happen . I wish the film did n't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it , although like I said the film has nothing to with wrestling , people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because , given of course if they are a wrestling hater .

14587,"`` WARNING : MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS < br / > < br / > The ripples in the wake of the first `` '' Jaws '' '' movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond . Movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience ( ie : the ocean , deep space , genetics ) . Although `` '' Jaws '' '' was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror , few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original . `` `` Shark rosso nell'oceano '' '' ( aka Devil Fish or Red Ocean ) , is a dutiful follower of the original `` '' Jaws '' '' formula . After several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature , there is an initial drive to discover the beast , then a failure to study it without horrible results , and a final push to destroy it . Although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy , the result is nothing short of disastrous . This movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing , brittle acting , and cheap scares. < br / > < br / > The most sickly compelling feature of `` '' Devil Fish '' '' is its cookie-cutter editing . From the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together , the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility . It appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music . Furthermore , every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms `` '' fade '' '' , `` '' wipe '' '' , or `` '' dissolve '' '' . The impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins . Silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies. < br / > < br / > The music is equally bland . The creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the `` '' Jaws '' '' theme with slight variation . Although I like to keep my reviews devoid of MST3K influence , Mike most aptly described the somber score as `` '' soft core porn music '' '' . Failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to `` '' Devil Fish '' '' . The acting is stale , the relationships baffling , and the whole conspiracy is laughable . The question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests , why could n't a more practical use be administered to better mankind ? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster , even though its film presence is less than stellar. < br / > < br / > Overall , this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre . If `` '' Jaws '' '' had never been made , then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively . Sadly , as a carbon copy of Spielberg 's original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese . ''",0,negative
2842,"`` Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD . Yes , the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book , BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution . I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian , culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago ! Amazing the power of film on a child 's imagination , eh ? In high school I read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip . Now , true this film was made in the `` '' old school '' '' style , meaning that Egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blue-eyed Brits . However , has anyone seen the current HBO series `` '' ROME '' '' ? Everything old is olde again . One ca n't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as Mayfair aristocrats in Roman drag . Not one actor on ROME could pass for an ancient Italian . That being said , the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history . This film is immensely appealing ( to borrow a word from NEFER ) for its historical information ( BEER ! BRAIN SURGERY ! IRON ! ) and its gorgeous cinematography and score . I have a dreadful Taiwan DVD version which I watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available . For anyone else interested in this subject I highly recommend the historical novel `` '' A God Against The Gods '' '' by the author of Advise and Consent . If anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact Fox to urge them on , please let me know ! ''",1,positive

Four of the most intolerable teenage characters you 'll ever see  they 're like a combination of ugly , stupid and annoying  go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit . Do n't even ask me what the killer 's motivations were or even who he/she was , because if it did feature in the film , I totally missed it . This is one of the worst movies ever made , with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever . The production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable .

10761,"`` Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival , `` '' N - io e Napoleone '' '' is easy to love . First of all it can count on great production values , as very few Italian films nowadays can , with wonderful settings and costumes . The cast is great too . Director Virzì constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as `` '' a young De Niro '' '' . Now , of course he is going a way too far , but sure the boy can act . I loved his performance , and he did a great job with the ( tuscan ) accent . Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte . It 's really great to see him acting in Italian , I hope to see him working in Italy again very soon . The supporting cast worked well too - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices , but they all gave fine performances . Even Massimo Ceccherini , best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows , fitted in well and was actually funny . The low point of the cast was the `` '' Diva '' '' Monica Bellucci . Sure , she was slightly better than usual , but she managed to look ( and sound ) utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa Emilia , in which , with a good dose of self irony , she used her own umbro accent . The script , by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself is clever , with lots of laugh out loud lines , and a few very emotional moments too . Sure , the ending left me puzzled . The message is kind of ambiguous : the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate , but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else , sometimes funny , sometimes sad , sometimes pathetic , so that suddenly it 's difficult to hate him ; then , in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning . Personally , I dislike very much this notion . `` `` Io e Napoleone '' '' is still a pleasant film , the best presented at the Festival so far ( the other being Fur and the Hoax ) .

13620,"`` In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz ) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur ( James Marsden ) . One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key . By the late afternoon , a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer . This man is Arlington Steward ( Frank Langella ) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash . If they do n't press it , nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else . Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal . The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties . Arthur , who is currently working for NASA , fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma , who is a teacher , learns that her faculty funding is being cut. < br / > < br / > One 's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller , based on the short story `` '' Button Button '' '' by Richard Matheson , will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise . The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household . Richard Kelly 's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes . Without the dream-like state of that far superior film , The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world , is entirely implausible . That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer , seems equally contrived. < br / > < br / > If this sounds unlikely so far , what follows is even more absurd , involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning , the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations . Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries , random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family , become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity . To a point , the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going . Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances . In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot . He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes . Later , at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending , this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them . Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow. < br / > < br / > What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on , many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration . The ending , which wo n't be spoilt here , resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy . While the resemblances can be seen , by this point , given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances , there is little reason to care . Cameron Diaz 's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film , with a very unsubtly written role , as the mysterious scarred man , who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr . Evil proud . It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon . There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do ; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly 's pastiche of ideas . Underdeveloped and brief conversations , such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them , highlights this. < br / > < br / > Since 2001 , Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko . Though this film might be intriguing for a little while , it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film 's rather illogical revelations . Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions , but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic . The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved . ''",0,negative

But , because it is so hard to describe ( and others have already done so ) , I wo n't even go there. < br / > < br / > As for the artwork , it 's very typical of one of these Japanese films , though there was one noticeable change . There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds . This was NOT a bad thing at all -- the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique . In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton 's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film . With a high frame-rate , exceptional character animation ( which imbued them with tons of personality ) and a great `` '' wow-factor '' '' , this is an exceptional film for all ages . Though clearly designed more for younger audiences ( the TOTORO fans especially ) , it is a bit scary here and there ( during the storm segments ) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults . As an adult ( at least chronologically so ) , I loved the cute stuff and applaud the other-worldliness of the film. < br / > < br / > A great film -- among Miyazaki 's best . I do n't give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do that -- plus I did like a few of the studio 's other films a bit more ( particularly TOTORO ) . But that DOES N'T mean you should n't rush out now and see it -- do it and do yourself a favor . ''",1,positive
24696,"Your idol will deceive you in this movie . Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father 's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old . This makes his relationship ( a collection of copulation scenes , basically ) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing . The character 's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe . Nichols , who is one of daytime TV 's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie : watching him have sex over and over with this girl . It 's like watching two animals going at it . If you 're a fan of this actor 's talent in other projects , do n't rent this for you will never view him in the same way . If , on the other hand , you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera , you might like it : Stephen will show you his naked butt , lots of tongue work , his groaning range , but not his talent as this character who 's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera . He may have found it kinky but I did n't - a BIG deception !",0,negative
3673,"`` Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is sadly no exception . The novel , set in 1924 , concerns the partitioning of Ireland , in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon ' of the title ) . Due to a colossal blunder , half the village is now in Northern Ireland , the other half is in the Republic . Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path . Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint . A dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him. < br / > < br / > 'Puckoon ' is a sort of Irish 'Under Milk Wood ' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore . The lead character , Dan Milligan ( renamed 'Madigan ' in the film ) is impishly played by Sean Hughes , and has conversations with the narrator ( Richard Attenborough ) . Also in the film is Milo O'Shea , Griff Rhys Jones , David Kelly ( from 'Robin 's Nest ' ) , Freddie Jones , Joe McGann , and Elliott Gould. < br / > < br / > Interviewed for the 'Making of 'Puckoon ' documentary , writer/director Terence Ryan expressed undying admiration for the book . It shows on screen . But , alas , like the ill-fated film of 'The Hitch-Hiker 's Guide To The Galaxy ' , a good book does not necessarily make a good film . The trouble with 'Puckoon ' is that , like Milligan 's other books , they simply do not work on the big screen . 'Puckoon ' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. < br / > < br / > No way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men ' , 'Fat Slags ' , and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers ' , but then neither is it as good as it should have been . The last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police , the British army , some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin , and is really tedious to sit through . Ryan 's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film. < br / > < br / > The other problem is the total absence of charm . 'Waking Ned ' had this in spades , while the 'Father Ted ' television series was funnier by far . Spike lived long enough to see the film , and apparently enjoyed it . His daughter , Jane , has a cameo as Madigan 's bride. < br / > < br / > The highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning : `` '' I do n't mind dying ! `` `` , said Spike : `` '' I just do n't want to be there when it happens ! '' '' . ''",1,positive
16674,"Unspeakable starts in Los Angeles with Jim ( Roger Cline ) & his wife Alice Fhelleps ( Tamera Noll ) arguing as they drive along in the pouring rain , unfortunately Jim crashes the car & his daughter Heather ( Leigh Silver ) ends up dead while Alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetable . Devastated by the death of his daughter Jim starts visiting prostitutes , he then kills them because of voices in his head . Erm , that 's it really. < br / > < br / > Written , produced & directed by Chad Ferrin I hate Unspeakable as a film . There are some films you occasionally see that move the 'goal posts ' as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter , some films are so brilliant that all other 's will be judged by it while other 's like Unspeakable for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low . This is truly one of the worst films I 've ever seen & I am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the IMDb although I 'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page , I not sure if I missed something but for a start Unspeakable has no plot , it has no story & a lot of it seems almost random . There was nothing in Unspeakable to maintain my interest or entertain & as a result became a test of endurance to get through to the end . The film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest , there is a scene in which a disabled person craps herself , it splats on the floor & her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her soiled genitals , legs & underwear . If anyone can find such crap entertaining then I 'll just cut my wrists now , the character 's are some of the worst I 've had the misfortune to know , the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty faggot porno of the worst kind . It does n't work as a horror as it 's not scary in the slightest , it 's absolutely hilarious & frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss & attempting to cope with it & overall I just think it 's a pointless , rubbishy , badly made piece of crap from Troma. < br / > < br / > Director Ferrin films like some badly made documentary , the special effects are terrible & are of the 'let 's pour tomato ketchup on our actor 's face & the audience will be convinced that they died a gory death ' variety , there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth . Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum ... < br / > < br / > Apparently Unspeakable had a budget of about $ 20,000 & all I can say is where did all the money go ? Oh , a quick note to the filmmakers , if your going to record sound live make sure you do n't have your actor 's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of Los Angeles seem to be driving up ... The acting sucks , period. < br / > < br / > Unspeakable is , in my opinion , total crap . It 's probably not the worst I 've ever seen but it 's right down there & I ca n't remember seeing such a awful film recently . One to avoid unless your a masochist or insomniac .",0,negative
12365,"`` Since Jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense. < br / > < br / > This little film is different . Made in the early 80 's it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner . Then , you make those horrors simmer , just do n't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering. < br / > < br / > The story features Meg Tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with `` '' The Big Chill '' '' and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90 's . Meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls . They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt . The mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her. < br / > < br / > Meanwhile famed occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers . His daughter does n't believe this at first , but she listens to a tape about her father 's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations . She also learns that she may have inherited her father 's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead . I think you know where this story is headed , so I 'll stop here . Did I mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which Meg Tilly 's character is spending the night ? < br / > < br / > I will mention that the commercial DVD containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently . I saw it on TV in the mid 1980 's and I remember it looking better than this . The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the DVD had to be created from a print . This means it comes complete with dirt and scratches. < br / > < br / > This is worth checking out for any horror fan . It was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night TV until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986 . Only TCM Underground airs this kind of film anymore . ''",1,positive
8274,"It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing somewhat more than a little . And I think her talent as a comedienne can only be really understood once one has struggled through a sonata by Haydn or a song by Debussy and made a success of it . Her instrument is her voice and her handling of it is pure musicianship . She could tackle any part . The only thing she could n't do was to not make a success of it . This film is a perfect example . In it , she channels Ruth Gordon ( because the play is the thing ) , is feminine , charming , willful and self-effacing , generous , protective and combative but never pretentious . She manages to stay as believable as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb . The viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it . It is refreshing to see a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons . I sincerely hope the entire Dunne oeuvre makes it to DVD one day because it 's really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few initiates .",1,positive
959,"I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious ; It 's not like American Pie or something . I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs ; since it 's part of the plot , the advertising is excusable. < br / > < br / > This is a funny movie with good dialogue , good subtle wit , a good story , a good moral ( that thankfully does n't get too sappy ) , GREAT acting , and a cheesy ending. < br / > < br / > ( minor spoiler ) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy ( Muniz ) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf ( Giamatti ) comes along . So he gets his best friend Kaylee ( Bynes ) and they go and drive the Wolf crazy. < br / > < br / > Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles , but not as Jason Shepherd . He handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well , and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness. < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes . What more can I say ? The girl 's got the gift . She 's funny , talented , versatile , and very , very attractive . ( I 'm only 6 months older than her . I need to get to California sometime soon . ) In fact , the 'best-friend ' part was originally a boy , but became a girl as soon as the makers saw Amanda 's interest . Which works out pretty well , since the part would 've been pretty dull without the blessing of Bynes 's abilities. < br / > < br / > Paul Giamatti is a very talented man . While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical , Giamatti made him-not just a jerk , mind you , but a LIKEABLE jerk , a jerk that livens up the screen , rather than intentionally dimming it . And I doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that Wolf undergoes as well. < br / > < br / > All in all , great movie . Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself . Loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film . ( one of the guests in the party scene is the director , Shawn Levy , another is Bynes 's former co-star Kenan Thompson ) Loved seeing Amanda in those outfits ... ... .. Get the DVD if you can .

I was n't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away . In fact the rest of the film continued to give little away ! No real plot , no action , no suspense , very little drama and , except for a short section at the very end , no scenery. < br / > < br / > The result of lack of all of these features was , however , a wonderful film . I do n't fully understand why , but I think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect . The acting , script and , most important of all , the casting were all spot on and I ca n't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good , but I still ca n't work out why . I just know that I will be getting the DVD ( this is one of those films that will , I am sure , be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience , provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it ! ) and I will be watching it again soon .

1818,"I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight . I must say , I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot . I was completely mistaken . This movie was not only incredibly entertaining , but everything about it I simply loved . Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever . The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi , you know , Sam 's little brother . He played the mad doctor 's henchman to the greatest extent . Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue , he did nothing but shine . But i really can not ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell . Though I did think that Ted Raimi stole the show , Bruce did what he does best on the big screen . Somewhere between the sketchy nasty American business man and the tragic victim , he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences . The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers . The crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took. < br / > < br / > This movie may not be Oscar material , but my goodness , it was amazing .

14279,"A child-like puppeteer , for a public access children 's show , goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse . This movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across . Not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse . Seemingly harmless , Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children . The children are emotionless and zombie-like ( ..due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them ) , the parents loud , inconceivably harsh , contemptible , and belligerent . The mothers , in particular , are so obscene , you 'll root for their execution . They are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids . Our detectives are a tired lot , frustrated with the whole judicial process , how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission . While the crimes themselves are heinous , the film does n't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen . I 'd say the reason to see this is for Tom Basham 's performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis . There 's quite a weird dinner table sequence between Basham 's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child , regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark ( ..notice the changes in behavior , pretty impressive work , going from innocent to creepy ) . Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes , the detective in charge of the homicides cases , expressing on his face the strain that is taking it 's toll on him . There 's an early performance by John Ashton as detective Matthews , always raising the ire of Hayes because of his inability to follow directions , not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids . Awkward laid-back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this . Controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much . A bit too slow moving for my tastes , but there 's an effective use , I felt , of Basham 's eyes before he takes care of business , waiting patiently as he prepares to strike .",0,negative
17917,"I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded . A subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard , failed miserably. < br / > < br / > Rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control , the scenes here were for the most part pathetic . It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed . And the victim 's laugh with the cops , when he aborted his police complaint , seemed as genuine as that of the cops . No awkwardness , no hesitance to merely join in . I do n't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely . As for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers , pathetic . They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves , and had him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police . The story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to any project he does. < br / > < br / > The only concrete revelation of this movie , is , it was crap .",0,negative

1747,"As talk-shows go , Larry King Live is not bad , and since he occasionally gets good guests , it 's a show to turn on once in awhile , but not compulsively . When Bill Maher , Carl Bernstein , a former president , or other substantive guests sit across from him , it 's not too bad . Other times , he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars . During the OJ Simpson trial , it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case . But is this really journalism ? Or the National Enquirer on the tube ? Sometimes , it comes off a little bit like trash television -- Jerry Springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience. < br / > < br / > On the other side , King 's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety . That said , Larry King is not a bad interviewer , but alas , he is not a great one . King does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented , especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics . Always seems like the minute King ca n't quite deal with the issue at hand , that 's when he turns to the phone calls , maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has . He might interview someone like David Gergen , but may not have read any of his books . Sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script. < br / > < br / > When it 's an entertainment celebrity , no problem . He can come off like he 's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway . Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science . And I notice he usually has seen the star 's latest movie . Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book . However , if it 's the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward , King comes off a little like he did n't quite finish his homework . So off to the phones. < br / > < br / > If you are looking for real in-depth interviewing , Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States . She reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas . I do n't see King quite doing that . Granted , he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross , which may say more about the American audience than King .

Kurtz had eventually come to know this. < br / > < br / > Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture , to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists , especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz 's darkened lair , you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie . Kurtz 's subtle deal with his executioner , his unilateral 'surrender ' in return for Willard agreeing ( did he nod ? ) to tell Kurtz 's 'son ' ( another metaphor for us , the next generation , the ones watching the movie ) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam , is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard , -- interlaced with some of his own horror stories , is incredible , nay , genius , film .

I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched it being an `` '' Evil Dead '' '' fan . The Swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece . A criminal tries to break into the house Evil Ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says `` '' groovy '' '' as he looks at his weapon quite like Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2 . There is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie . They do n't just spoof Evil Dead , as there is a Gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at Ed in his refrigerator . My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says `` '' I 'm coming to get you Barbra '' '' which in case you did'nt know is Barbra 's brothers main line in `` '' Night of the Living Dead '' '' . This movie pretty much has it all good plot , cool characters , funny stuff ( Gremlin puppet ) , scary stuff ( demon doctor ) , excellent effects ( exploding head ) and a fair amount of female nudity . I only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before Ed goes insane but its well worth the wait . So if you liked `` '' Evil Dead 2 '' '' or any of the other movies I mentioned above you got ta rent and watch it with a freind , and when your done try `` '' Brain Dead '' '' because I hear it is similiar to this masterpiece . < br / > < br / > ''",1,positive
24716,"`` For the record , I hate spoof movies . Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE ! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés , not the actual movies itself .

I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman ! The characters did not represent any women that I know , they were boring , bitter and melodramatic .

It has a good deal of humor , and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale. < br / > < br / > '' '' Sweeney Todd '' '' tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in England .

At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a `` '' creative writing '' '' course . Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure .

7955,"`` The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character , rather than star turns , the need to stage special effects , obligatory romance , and endless car chases . However , there is a car chase in here , and a dandy it is . Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer `` '' recruited '' '' to eliminate him . It is rare that a second or third tier actor , such as Quinn , is given an important starring role like this that carries a film . Usually , such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw , which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it . Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous , somewhat creepy at times , agent that recruits Quinn . Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent . The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines , which converge in gradual fashion toward the end , and not all at once as we 're used to seeing . The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity . The locations are convincing and effective . The soundtrack is nothing special , but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days , without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments ; unconvincing star turns ; loud , annoying , music video type soundtracks ; a villain that hams it up ; and repeatedly a cast , costumes , and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 .

Like `` '' Aces High '' '' , it alternates between viscerally exciting ( or scary ) air combat sequences , where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they 'd come to care about , but also unpredictable interactions on the ground , where skillful writers and real-life experiences inform some involving and moving events . This also underlines the fact that for many people , 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another , and even today we still do n't recognise the loss , bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes , or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails - making their sacrifices all the more valiant. < br / > < br / > Watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy , and back to love that endures even beyond death .

12591,"`` It 's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender , and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through. < br / > < br / > Now let me go on record by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy films . From the fun and silly , to those focusing on martial arts , to the more dramatic and romantic typesit 's a genre I very much enjoy . Films like `` '' A Chinese Odyssey : Pandora 's Box '' '' and `` '' A Chinese Odyssey : Cinderella '' '' ( both of which were written and/or directed by Jeffrey Lau ) ; `` '' The Bride with White Hair '' '' ; `` '' Butterfly & Sword '' '' ; `` '' Green Snake '' '' ; `` '' A Chinese Ghost Story '' '' ; `` '' Swordman II '' '' ; `` '' Zu : Warriors from the Magic Mountain '' '' ; `` '' Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon '' '' ; and others . Which is why I was looking forward to `` '' A Chinese Tall Story . '' '' One of the film 's characters is the `` '' Monkey King '' '' ( aka Sun Wukong ) , an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology , first told in the stories of the `` '' Journey to the West , '' '' the epic adventure written about 500 years ago . ( The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the `` '' Chinese Odyssey '' '' films , amongst many others ) . Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng ( the pig character ) and Sha Wujing. < br / > < br / > So how does it all go wrong ? Well , let 's take an example familiar to Western audiences . How about the Robin Hood mythology ? A well known story from ye olden days . Let 's say that our Robin Hood film starred Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood , and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck . Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez . Let 's give Sir Robin an Uzi as well , because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham . They might need rocket packs also , and while we 're at it , give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy . If you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the Robin Hood tale , then `` '' A Chinese Tall Story '' '' is the movie for you ! As I indicated above , this movie is a jumbled mess . In the first 30 minutes , we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong , Zhu Wuneng , and Sha Wujing , but also to the monk Tripitaka ( who is actually the main protagonist ) , kidnapped children , a `` '' millennium bug demon '' '' ( which shoots laser beams ) , an underground Tree God , a lizard imp tribe , an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg , the Lord Chancellor Tortoise , a Sea Dragon King , a ever-morphing magic golden staff , a chatterbox imp girl , wormholes in space , and the Four Heavenly Knights . All this would n't be too bad -- the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements . But I guarantee you the Chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film . ( Helpful advice to the filmmakers : Just because your computer effects guys CAN come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war , does not mean they SHOULD ) . < br / > < br / > You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks ( and I am not making this upit 's a direct quote from the commentary ) `` '' I asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing . '' '' Is there a story hidden in here somewhere ? Yes . Yes , there is . Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka ( played by Nicholas Tse '' '' Gen-X Cops , '' '' `` '' Time and Tide , '' '' `` '' My Schoolmate the Barbarian '' '' ) and Meiyan , the lizard imp girl ( played by Charlene Choi and a computer ) . Choi is the best thing going in this film . You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group `` '' Twins '' '' and from other films such as `` '' The Twins Effect '' '' ( a fun flick ) and `` '' Just One Look '' '' ( a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy ) . Poor Choi , being a lizard imp and all , is hardly recognizable with her warts , snagged out teeth , doughy nose , and hunched back . That is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her , which somehow makes it worse . Tse is passable , but all of the supporting actors were abysmal . A couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted. < br / > < br / > At one point I was debating with myself if `` '' A Chinese Tall Story '' '' was a spoof . I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl ( played by a very pretty Fan Bing-Bing ) got out and lit up a Marlboro ( ! ) while talking with Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume ( ! ! ) . But it is not a spoof . Of course there is the typical Hong Kong silliness , but the movie takes itself seriously enough , with enough scenes of romance and pathos ( scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos ) and rousing action and adventure. < br / > < br / > You might think that you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it would n't cost you anything . ( Oh , but it 'll cost you , all right ) . < br / > < br / > Is there anything good to say ? Sure . The colors are vibrant ( they are the best thing about this movie ) . And the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard . Too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game . ''",0,negative
8157,"Being quite a fan of Charlie Chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'The Gold Rush ' and then 'City Lights ' , I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator ' as I had been told this was , arguably , his best film . I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie ; my first one , Chaplin-wise. < br / > < br / > The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound , Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking ; it 's funny , well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes . It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin ' opening and at the same time , kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another . What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed . Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel ' in this film , was funny and even now ; makes you think back as you know exactly who he 's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind . The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era . My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave , only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words ; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and , indeed , laugh at him. < br / > < br / > Historically , the film got a few things right as well . Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children ; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here , Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored ; stabbing at Hitler 's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy ( Oh , he hugs and kisses children . He must be OK ! ) . The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious . Films such as 'The Pianist ' and 'Come and See ' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior ' people which nowadays , we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930 's when this was filmed , the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement . Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off. < br / > < br / > What I did n't like about the film , however , was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening . This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat . The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories . These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel 's palace whereas none of these were actually developed . The 'giving a woman a shave ' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed ' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end , just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out , unfunny gags which was disappointing. < br / > < br / > During the final straight , The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film . It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower ' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks ( although , they are humorously foiled ) . Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat , The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that 's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there .",1,positive
9153,"`` François Villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in Paris in the 15th century . However , most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction -- from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century . Whereas in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI , in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film . In reality , he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law -- not the combination of a patriot and Robin Hood-like character like he is in the film . Provided you know that the film is nearly 100 % fiction , then it 's well worth seeing -- just do n't assume it 's a good history lesson. < br / > < br / > In THE BELOVED ROGUE , Villon is played with wild abandon by John Barrymore . I was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces . Angelo Rossitto , who was the plucky dwarf , played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career . Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films . Mack Swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of Chaplin 's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH . All four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints -- -even with Barrymore 's rather over-the-top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a Douglas Fairbanks performance . However , the performance I had a serious problem with was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI . To call this `` '' unsubtle '' '' would be a gross understatement . He played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical Richard III -- skulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature . While Veidt was wonderful in many , many films ( both silent and sound ) but here he is just ridiculous. < br / > < br / > As for the story , it 's full of lusty adventure and action -- like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships . The sets worked out well for all this , as they 'd been used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME . Both films were set around the same time period. < br / > < br / > Overall , it 's one of the last great silent films . There 's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance , comedy and action . Well worth seeing , though it loses a couple of points for Veidt 's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history. < br / > < br / > By the way , this film was also made twice as IF I WERE KING ( 1920 and 1938 ) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play . However , in total , six films have been about Villon and tell , more or less , variations on the same tale ! ''",1,positive

15443,"While I was watching this movie I never thought I 'd be defending it . It 's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot . There 's no real characters to latch onto except the killer . Some of the acting can be better , but most of it is capable. < br / > < br / > I know , a three out of ten is n't stellar , but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless , etc . I think it set out to do what it 's supposed to fairly well . The lighting is minimal at times , more natural than most audiences are used to , but it 's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film . In fact , at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that , but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that 's truly that bad. < br / > < br / > It 's not particularly scary , but it is disturbing at times .

6878,"I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival . In twelve brief but exquisite minutes , Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society . The film embodies elegant direction , moving performances and a heart- rending story . Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers . And , in his first venture into dramatic narrative , Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future . I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film . It 's difficult to describe talent , but as this debut film demonstrates , you know it when you see it !",1,positive
21803,"`` Out of all the films I could have chosen , it had to be this . When I was last in New York I went into a Times Square store and out of the hundreds of DVD 's they had I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks ( 1976 ) and this , on a double feature DVD that also included Seeds of Sin ( 1968 ) , did I regret it ? Read on to find out . The film opens on an island ( near Milligan 's Staten Island home ) where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper , at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift . Out of nowhere Colin ( Hal Borske ) a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all . After the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music I have ever heard , at least it got me used to it as it 's used constantly throughout the film , we are introduced to three couples . The wives are all sisters , Vicky ( Ann Linden ) and Ricard ( Fib LaBlaque ) , Veronica ( Eileen Hayes ) and Bill ( Don Williams ) plus Elizabeth ( Carol Vogel ) and Donald ( Richard Ramos ) . They each receive a letter from a lawyer , H. Dobbs ( Neil Flanagan ) that request a meeting so he can read their late father 's will . Dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home 'Crenshaw House ' and fill it with 'sexual harmony and marital love ' that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother . He informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal . After three days the inheritance will be settled . The couples are also told about the servants , Martha ( Veronica Radburn ) , Hattie ( Maggie Rodgers ) and the retarded Colin , who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them . Later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says 'blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit ' . This starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets. < br / > < br / > Co-written , photographed and directed by the talentless Andy Milligan . This is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible . Lets go through just some of it 's faults . The music , it 's awful and headache inducing . Sound , you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes do n't have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear Milligan shouting out orders to his actors , oh and there 's a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well . The acting , probably among the worst I have ever witnessed . The very un-special effects , Colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence , it 's the size of a tennis ball , the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off . Photography , Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene , he regularly cuts the top , bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like it 's operated by someone who is constantly tripping over . There is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen . The film is often so dark you ca n't see whats happening , too . Editing , again some of the worst I 've ever sat through , he seems to cut scenes before they 've finished , cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence . The script , if there was one , credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood ( It took two people to write this ! ? ) is all over the place and is incredibly stupid . There is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement , the killer walks right behind him , at one point the potential victim turns around . What does the killer do to avoid being spotted ? They duck down right in from of him , the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he does n't notice them , right in front of him . You have to see this sequence to believe it , I still ca n't believe what I saw . Bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear , check the scene out when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter ( producer and co-writer Hal Sherwood ) , who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married ! A strange scene that 's there for no reason at all . Martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder , she 's more bothered by the fact that it 's thrown her dinner schedule out ! There 's load of insane dialogue as well , Patty and Martha discuss Colin , Patty says `` '' if only I did n't beat him so hard '' '' Martha sympathetically replies `` '' you have to Patty , you have to ! `` `` , delivered totally straight faced . And do n't start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house ! The only good thing I can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable , for the time period it 's meant to be set in . I could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is , but I think you get the idea . One to avoid unless your a serious masochist !

8550,"`` A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of `` '' Ray , '' '' a 2004 film also starring Kerry Washington , Regina King , Curtis Armstrong , Richard Schiff , Sharon Warren , Patrick Bachau , and many others , all giving excellent support to the film. < br / > < br / > The film has several main focuses : the first is Charles ' childhood - the drowning of his brother George which haunted him for years , the glaucoma that blinded him , and the strength taught him by his mother - do n't bend , do n't break , do n't ever be a cripple . She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles ' gift of music is discovered . The next focus is Charles ' artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer , to his arrangements of gospel music , his foray into country music , and the unique sound that became Ray Charles . The third focus is Charles ' personal life - his marriage to Bea , his many affairs , his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation. < br / > < br / > Because Charles lived a packed 74 years , there 's a lot skipped . Though Charles was orphaned while in his teens , the death of his beloved mother , his rock , is n't in the film . While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs , his near-starvation as a musician is n't covered . At one point , he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it , but the jar broke . He was that down and out . Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia , which banned him , adopts `` '' Georgia on My Mind '' '' as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state , yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which is n't mentioned . She probably was there , however . Also , she was n't his only wife - he was married once before he met her ; that marriage is n't covered . In the movie , we 're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12 . It would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film. < br / > < br / > What is n't skipped is his glorious music , which seems to go on constantly throughout the film , continually reinforcing his genius and artistry. < br / > < br / > Charles ' story is compelling and holds the audience 's interest throughout . Those who scoff at it as a made-for-TV movie do n't give it the credit it deserves . Taylor Hackford 's direction gives `` '' Ray '' '' a good pace , and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully. < br / > < br / > As Ray , Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he 's a comedian playing a part . Foxx wore prosthetics , did his own piano playing , and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role . He nails him , but it 's not an impersonation - he 's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother 's body ; a man full of denial about his addiction , hating the word junkie and believing he 's not hooked ; and he 's in denial about his home life , thinking that his wife does n't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children ( in the movie , child ) ; and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on . He demands to be paid in $ 1 bills so they can be counted ; when he discovers he 's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal , he makes his own deal and leaves his job. < br / > < br / > One does n't so much marvel at Foxx 's performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera. < br / > < br / > This is an excellent biography , which , like `` '' Walk the Line '' '' is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist . Whether or not you 're a Ray Charles fan , `` '' Ray '' '' is something to experience . ''",1,positive

It walks a wonderful line between real , immediate suspense and a dark , distancing humor . Like many of Hitch 's heroes , our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her , at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear , at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy. < br / > < br / > The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out . Right from the opening shots , they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication ; who is to be trusted and who is a monster . The plot twists and turns unpredictably . Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork , imagery , music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters , which sends raw fear right into you . < br / > < br / > A warning : there is some frighteningly real gore , as well as some nudity . The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic. < br / > < br / > And a teen-slasher pic it AI N'T .

I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC . I was fortunate to see it at a local showing . At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props , such as the bus ( 1938 Greyhound ) used in the movie . The bus had no reverse gear and during filming , the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point . Those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me . The film accurately depicts life in this area during WWII . A well done film and I anxiously await the DVD availability .",1,positive
2250,"Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power . Often misunderstood , the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for ; satirical farce . This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita ( of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies ) , but was marked by its ribaldary , irreverence , and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day . It was ahead of its time ( 1972 ) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later . As such , it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan , who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed .

18161,"Red Sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong-direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger . Having made a couple of sword ' n ' sorcery films ( as Conan ) he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like The Terminator and Commando , only to make a mystifying return to the sword ' n ' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle . It 's hard to figure out why he bothered , as this is weaker than both Conan films in every conceivable department . Allegedly , this was to have been the third Conan film , but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character , the titular red-head , leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role . Spare a thought , too , for director Richard Fleischer who had given the world classics like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea , Fantastic Voyage , The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place . In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards. < br / > < br / > Evil queen Gedren ( Sandahl Bergman ) wants to rule the world , and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so . She and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman , massacring the helpless priestesses as they go . One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja ( Brigitte Nielsen ) , a fiery red-headed warrior , who upon hearing of her sister 's death swears revenge upon the evil Gedren . Sonja rides across the land in search of Gedren 's lair . Along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince , Tarn ( Ernie Reyes Jr ) and his bodyguard Falkon ( Paul Smith ) . She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry , I mean Kalidor ( ! ) - who offers to join her in her quest . Initially Sonja does n't want the help of Kalidor ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) , preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone , but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance. < br / > < br / > Red Sonja is a staggeringly poor film , all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword ' n ' sorcery genre was close to its end . It seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind . The performances are poor on the whole , ranging from Bergman 's embarrassingly OTT villain to Reyes ' unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to Schwarzenegger 's wooden and unenthusiastic hero . Nielsen is slightly better as the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role - but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser 's script . The film is riddled with goofs , including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys but in a long-shot in the same sequence there is n't a corpse in sight . Technically it is very inept too , with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters . There are a few compensations , such as Ennio Morricone 's enjoyable music ( Morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films , e.g The Island , Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra ) . Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunno 's lensing of the locations - in fact , much of the time it 's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground ! There were very few sword ' n ' sorcery films after Red Sonja , so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre .",0,negative

While you 're still wondering what they 're going on vacation from as they had n't had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 ( with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie ) they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper. < br / > < br / > They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered , by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in Miami . Suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence  and Goldie for the murder . To console himself Goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures : `` '' On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair '' '' for one . Some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies . Favourite bit : the dignified game of hide and seek/hunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave Lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train . Least favourite bit : the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut  definitely thrown in for the kids ! < br / > < br / > All in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing , with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie , although RKO were churning these out faster . Absolutely no sex , not much violence ( in fact none at all by today 's high standards ) , and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars. < br / > < br / > Three Diet Falcon 's were made later with John Calvert in the title role , I do n't mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series , which Tom Conway had made his own by this time . Sad also that it was all downhill after this for Conway , who moved into TV , voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 rather well in 1953 . He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems  I do n't know if they were linked  wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend 's bed .

7516,"`` I first saw this film by chance when I was visiting my uncle in Arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago . The VHS print was a little faded looking , but I was very haunted by what I had watched . Did it all make sense ? Well , honestly , no it did n't . However , this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects . The beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression. < br / > < br / > Well , when I found out that Anchor Bay had released this oddity on DVD , I picked it up immediately . I was very pleased by the transfer , though I felt the extras rather lacking . Though the film concerns the `` '' O '' '' and Sir Stephen characters , it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage 's original novel or the 1974 film The Story of O . However , the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind . `` `` O '' '' decides to prostitute herself for Sir Stephen in violent 1920s Hong Kong . Her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men . Naturally , Sir Stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress . However , the tables are turned when `` '' O '' '' actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer . Suddenly , Sir Stephen feels the threat ... < br / > < br / > I feel that the deep meaning behind the film ( including the tragic score and artistic direction ) really make this film a classic . The viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of `` '' O '' '' 's fellow brothel mates , but the turmoil of 1920s Hong Kong is also explored . Like the political setting , the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging . No one is happy in the film , even if they believe that they are . ( However , `` '' O '' '' does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer ) . One prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk , naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog . Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress . She can not let that vision go . She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river . < br / > < br / > As for `` '' O '' '' , she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle . When he leaves , she feels a sense of abandonment . Of course , in that same flashback Kinski suddenly becomes her father . I was very , very disturbed by this image . I truly felt for `` '' O '' '' at this point in the film . She hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why . Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love . < br / > < br / > Another curious aspect of the film is the young child ( that ages at the end ) that sells fortune in a box . It is a very random character , but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film . At one point , the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people . Now , if that is n't symbolism for you ! ( Laugh ) < br / > < br / > All in all , I really love this film . I feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience . It has erotic scenes , but the scenes are n't really meant to arouse . Like the lives of the characters , the sex acts are empty . They are motions , but lack feeling and tenderness . ( Once again , the only tender scene is between `` '' O '' '' and the young man ) . `` `` O '' '' believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor , however , she finds in the end that she has choices . She too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness , however , she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew . The director leaves a lot of unanswered questions , however , some things do n't need answers . The viewer will make the judgment that works for them . < br / > < br / > I must say that I wish a special edition of this DVD would be released that had director commentary . I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later . It is a shame that the soundtrack was never released . This film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score . There is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine . I can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music . ''",1,positive
20975,"`` YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941 ) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar ( WWII ) . Some of these films maintained their status .

18688,"This movie is not that good at all.Its pretty stupid , pretty annoying , and very poorly done.I really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.Although I did n't hate it as much as them , I still found it to be a pretty bad film.The only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times , and also I feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast , not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival , and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.Instead it is n't but instead what it is now , a crappy film.The acting is atrocious I felt as if I was watching a couple of teens act for like a Halloween show or Thrill ride or something.The kills are pretty cheap ( as is the film itself ) , and basically everything else is low-class.Overall this film really is bad and you would n't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film. < br / > < br / > 3.8 out of 10 stars",0,negative

( Although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter . ) The material -- that is the problem . I feel as though the screenwriter/director watched the entire run of Felicity in one sitting , then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep . It really did remind me of Felicity -- a thoughtful young woman finding herself , finding love , with a shake-them-up-and- see-what-happens approach to the characters and their relationships . Except that while I usually enjoyed watching Felicity , this movie left me cold . The writing is just awful . It 's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did , as the dialogue is dull at best . At its worst it becomes trite , stilted and amateurish . There is nothing original here , with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that were n't so brilliant to begin with . ( Angels and fortune tellers ? Come on . ) For the first half of the movie , I rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience . By the second half , I just wished for it to end already .

2168,"`` There is a serious scene in this movie . A scene that lets you know that his film wo n't be pulling many cheap punches . It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons . They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire . The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire . Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick . I call it honesty . Most action movies tend to lean toward the `` '' safe side '' '' of showing violence and plot elements . This mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we do n't see them die . The violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying . A bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd. < br / > < br / > Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first ( and sadly only ) hit , Die Hard 2 . The villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across . The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on-board going down , but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used . However , to fit the spirit of the first film , Die Hard 2 was mostly a `` '' fun action movie . '' '' Here , that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive . The violence is bloody . The one liners are hilarious , but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action . The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films . The villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power . It is less ridiculous , but also more frightening than that . From recent films , the `` '' Bourne '' '' trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style , but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before `` '' The Bourne Identity '' '' with Matt Damon made it to the big screen. < br / > < br / > Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine . And this is well before the movie version of `` '' Tomb Raider '' '' became a hit . What 's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down John McClane and then take his still lit cigarette . This movie marks Geena Davis 's second action-heroine role and she still did n't manage to score a hit . While Angelina Jolie stars in `` '' Tomb Raider '' '' years later and scores a hit . The reasons are beyond me . Completely. < br / > < br / > Lastly , this movie is n't all dark edged . There are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film . The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics , with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break . Thus , there is formula here , but it is the Anti-Formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula . -- - 9/10 < br / > < br / > BsCDb Classification : 13+ -- - violence , profanity ''",1,positive

5474,"`` `` '' Imaginary Heroes '' '' is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver , Jeff Daniels , Emile Hirsch , Michelle Williams , and Kip Pardue. < br / > < br / > The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child ( Pardue ) commits suicide. < br / > < br / > '' '' Ordinary People '' '' has been mentioned often in relation to this film ; it 's sort of `` '' Ordinary People '' '' with a role reversal . The mother in this case , Sandy Travis ( Weaver ) is more accessible than the father , Ben ( Daniels ) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope . Like `` '' Ordinary People , '' '' the younger son Tim ( Hirsch ) is the focus of the film. < br / > < br / > For me , the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it . There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son , mother and neighbor , brother and sister ( Williams ) and some good offbeat moments . What never clicked was Ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with Sandy . This seems to have been the goal of director/writer Dan Harris . In one scene in a grocery store , the checkout kid assumes Sandy is `` '' about 30 '' '' and gives her his phone number . In almost the next scene , Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday . Weaver was 55 when this film was made , actually probably 54 , and looks phenomenal . So what is Ben looking at ? However , there 's something askew about Ben 's complete detachment because the viewer does n't really see how Daniels ever WAS attached to that family. < br / > < br / > The end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes . Everyone is very good , with Weaver and Hirsch being the standouts. < br / > < br / > There 's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares .

It does n't for me have enough that I would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but I did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film . Louhimies said that back in Finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it .

3189,"`` Like many a child born in the 1980 's , I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that were n't necessarily the 'racier ' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 ( I saw those , of course , though not as frequently as now ) , but the ones meant for the `` '' whole family '' '' , Spaceballs , and this film . I knew at the time I was n't seeing great art , but just a campy , goofy , though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and/or adventure movies . But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a ) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids , if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities , and b ) once a kid sees it , when he revisits it , as I have a few times , it 's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around . It 's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies ( Godfather of course , as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times ) , but one that references Brooks 's own movies as well ; this is a filmmaker who is n't above poking fun at even his own style. < br / > < br / > Basic story- Robin Hood ( Cary Elwes in one of his best turns ) returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with King Richard gone , and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to , naturally , rob the rich to feed the poor . Along the way he meets Achoo ( Dave Chappelle ) , butts heads with Prince John ( Richard Lewis ) and the Sheriff , and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian . This , of course , is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes , and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing , so much of it sticks that it 's hard not to chuckle . It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm , such as the Godfather bit ( Dom DeLouise at his very best ) , Brooks 's own cameo as the Rabbbi , Lewis and Chappelle 's acting turns , and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs . Some of it is obvious , yes , some of it just takes right from the pages of Blazing Saddles , sure , but is it a good time for the right crowd ? Definitely- and for parents who grew up on the 70 's Brooks work , it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this ( even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated , all in good fun ) .

What is with the musical score ? . Do n't tell me Poledouris could n't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time . A series ( TV or Movie ) soundtrack is part of its personality . Part of its character . When you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters we 're watching .

It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now . The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible . He was the highlight of the movie . Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding . He was the total star of the show . Benoit 's character cracked me up ... was very funny . And the girl ( forget the name ) was great too . They were all great ! There were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys . And basically I just loved the movie . Everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival . Was my favorite from the festival . It really beautifully captured the liveliness of India and ca n't believe how beautiful India is . The feeling upon walking out of the cinema..was a real high . It is a delightful , happy film . I loved it ! !",1,positive
7841,"This is not your typical Indian film . There is some great sense of humanity , and the characters are pretty realistic . There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships , and there is a sense of guilt , grief , passion , passivity among the many characters . While seeing this , one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations . The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization , and yet , human relations are still preserved and nurtured . Saw it on DVD , the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting . Was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well ( or not being shown ) in India ( ... but maybe not too surprised ) . The artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations , as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today . Great film .",1,positive

23284,"`` There is no reason to watch this film. < br / > < br / > Why ? Many reasons . First up , the acting is awful . There is hardly a line that is n't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality , stupidity , and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth . It is awfully written . One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character 's line. < br / > < br / > '' '' Repeat ? '' '' < br / > < br / > '' '' Yes , they repeat it . For the whole movie . '' '' < br / > < br / > '' '' The whole movie ? '' '' < br / > < br / > '' '' Yes , the whole movie . '' '' < br / > < br / > Etc . < br / > < br / > In movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after . ( All the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys . Setting up a good `` '' Mwahahaha ! with X in my grasp I will rule the Universe ! '' '' villain is the first stop in any cheapo SF plot ) but in this turkey ? - you tell me. < br / > < br / > As I understand it our `` '' heros '' '' are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a Dirty Dozen type mission . They are sent by a fascistic totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from altering the course of history . The new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism , and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the Earth a dead planet ( we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on-screen situation reports just before the action starts , telling you who is who and what is what . It 's an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be , that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen - just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading . ) So just who are we supposed to be rooting for here ? I guess we are asked to believe our hero undertakes some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love , peace , and understanding while shooting loads of people - but that does n't work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent ( ish ) human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station. < br / > < br / > I guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap SF movies. < br / > < br / > The opening credits were nice .

12431,"Clouzot followed Le Corbeau , where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected , with another masterpiece , Quai des Orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset ( or think we do ) whodunnit . Top-billed Louis Jouvet does n't appear for forty minutes by which time Clouzot has established a rich milieu of Music Hall , music publishers , etc and a fine cast of colourful characters ; Angela Lansbury lookalike ( Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year ) Suzy Delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband/accompanist Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead . From here things go seriously wrong , his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre-arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile , unknown to him , his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour , a closet lesbian in love with her , who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve Delair 's scarf and as long as she 's there , thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon , a champagne bottle . At this point investigator Jouvet gets involved and from then on it 's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air . Clouzot 's output was relatively small but virtually all of it was , as Spencer Tracey said in another context , 'cherce ' , with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come .

Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line , the plot and the characters . Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it . I love the interaction between the players ; the subtle relationships ; the period atmosphere . Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth . The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts .

6874,"Joseph Conrad 's timeless novel , Heart of Darkness , was depicted in the 1994 movie . I have read Conrad 's novel , and I must say , even though I prefer the novel itself , the movie was a great depiction . The set and costume designs brought Conrad 's novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow 's journey . The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms , voices , and personalities . If you have read the novel , I recommend that you also view this movie . If you have not read the novel , however , the movie may be harder to follow . Conrad 's Heart of Darkness is too full of action , emotion , and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long . Therefore , if you have not read the novel , the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow . Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten . The basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets , costumes , and acting . Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad 's original work however .",1,positive

Please , please , just take my word : this is one you 'll want to stay away from . It 's so boring and dull , so insipid and uninspired , such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent . Burt Reynolds ? Wasted ( despite his best efforts ) . Ice-T is barely in the film , and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director , perhaps intimidated by Ice 's intense stare , did n't know what to do with him . Rob Lowe , as the title character , has never displayed so little on-screen charisma . Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself ; his performance is , in the saddest sense possible , a joke . Surely , Satan himself signed Mario 's check for this film . The plot is as weak , half-baked and annoying as all the music involved ( the utterly boring club song seems to continue on , literally , for the first third of the movie ) .

This includes a song sequence , where you 're told that there 's a million , rational ways to say `` '' No !

For example , Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits him out . If the writers were not high when writing this , I must recommend they try getting high because they ca n't get crazier than this . Of course , the film ignores the fact that Michael 's been having highs for two years by this point , so why this tripping sequence would frighten him is beyond me. < br / > < br / > I realize I 'm completely whaling on this film , but I actually just saw it again because I went through the trouble of tracking it down on eBay because of it 's sheer infamy of being a BAD cartoon .

21113,"Rozema 's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film . The 1999 film is reviled by many Austen purists , but I admire the job Rozema did in making Mansfield Park her own . It may not be strictly Jane Austen 's Mansfield Park , but at least it was well-written , beautifully shot , and well-acted by a superior cast . I do n't see how Austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from ITV ( and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theatre/PBS ) . The screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot , the production values are lackluster , and the cast ( apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson ) are largely guilty of bad acting . I ca n't think of a worst miscast than Billie Piper as Fanny Price . Her look was all wrong ( bleached hair and dark brows ? ? ) and her talent simply was n't suited to the material . Sir Thomas looked constipated the whole time . Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot , as were the actors who portrayed the Crawfords ( when I think how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version , I just kinda shake my head ) . < br / > < br / > I have n't seen the 1983 version , so I ca n't comment on it , but I 'd advise anyone who 's curious to give the '99 version a chance . Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind .",0,negative

My friend , who works at Magno Sound , told us that this movie was shot on Super 16 . The photography was so good , it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot . Furthermore , the music combined with Fred Carpenter 's direction , was art . The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching ... very cool .

283,"I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far , Jon Hewitt 's Acolytes. < br / > < br / > Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise . Get this two bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them . Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory , Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens . Add to that three , yes , thats right three great psycho 's ! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour , Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully , with swastika tattoos . Once you add these teens and these menacing adults , all hell breaks loose Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished . You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch 's Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own , in a Qld suburban back water , always ringing with the drones of emptiness . The script by Shayne Armstong , Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. < br / > < br / > If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens . The next Wolf Creek ? It could well be . It makes all the right moves . The teens are real ala Larry Clark . They do n't suck and have an attached PC agenda , they are non communicative , good looking and hip . The killers are dark with real menace . Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy , who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector . Dorman 's petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you ca n't wait to see buy the farm. < br / > < br / > The film is fast paced , tough and brutal . Not only that , it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination , if not award ! Its nuanced and poetic mise en scene , brilliant sound design , excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed Oz features I have seen so far this year. < br / > < br / > The film leaves you shaken , thinking and unsettled . Its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in Australian cinema at present . It will surely garner the interest of Hollywood . Oh , and did I mention it got into Toronto ? What other Oz feature films can say that much ? The world should get ready for a new auteur , Jon Hewitt .",1,positive

Now , I 'm going to state right at the beginning that I am VERY critical of the way weapons , especially firearms , are both portrayed , and handled , in movies . Being a war flick , portrayal was fine , but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have NEVER been tolerated by a real SEAL Team . The acting was more wooden than my first sailboat , the equipment carried ( or lack of it ) was laughable , and the dialogue was , shall we say , lacking in ANYTHING interesting . Well , with the exception of the journalist , which was actually prescient . Watching this movie was comparable to watching `` '' Palmetto '' '' with Woody Harrelson , where each scene was so bad you just could n't turn it off , because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene . Like Palmetto , they certainly did . The scene in the water , where , after shooting the first of the enemy , they BLOW THE DAMN BOAT UP , thereby having to face possible drowning , made me laugh so hard , that for a millisecond , I almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for . Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean ( the way it was filmed , with the many camera cuts , it looked like they went down about 80 feet . Nice continuity there ... . ) before slashing his throat was so damn stupid , I was stunned . Then again , so was the whole damn movie . I enjoy action movies , but not this one . NOTE : The version I watched was a TV version , pan & scan . I ca n't imagine that made a difference , except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter ! ''",0,negative

20019,"I ... I do n't know where to begin . Dragon Hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history . Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this , as it was intentionally bad . Showgirls ? No , it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film . But Dragon Hunt takes the cake , and eats it , then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man . It 's that much of a travesty. < br / > < br / > The acting , if it can even be called that , is rough . It does n't have the charm of improvised acting , so it must be scripted , but it 's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality . Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors ( or basically , those people on screen ) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from Saturday Night Live , which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera . I could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film , but you and I both do n't want to hear it. < br / > < br / > The make-up and special effects ( which , with most films , is the only good thing ) was laughably bad . The antagonist , whose name is so ridiculous I ca n't remember it , has a Mohawk glued to the top of his head . Yeah , glued to his head . And you can tell it 's glued on too , if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip , not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes . Thankfully he 's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film. < br / > < br / > There 's also some terrible character development , to put it lightly . The women , who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers ( and I mean , they are really pushed around ) , are not only ugly but ... gasp ... they do n't know what they 're doing ! In one scene they turn on their apparent lovers , join up with the even uglier bad guy , and then snort some coke . Apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine , because they started shaking and laughing EVEN before all of it went up their nostrils . Great timing girls ! Plus they wear some truly horrible stuff , clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s. < br / > < br / > Overall this movie , this film , this waste of film I should say , is also a waste of time .

23986,"Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist , helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best , but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy . The first story is a ham-fisted , meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise . The second achieves some poignancy , but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character . The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child 's Play . The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury , a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment ; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting . This is sheer stupidity masquerading as a guerilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections .",0,negative

It was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie. < br / > < br / > Visually it is quite beautiful , especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza . And the use of the soundtrack music , which as far as I can tell is exclusively by Pink Floyd , is excellent . It was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me , mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film . Dave Gilmour 's brief `` '' A Spanish Piece '' '' was the only one I did n't hear , and several tracks are used quite prominently , especially `` '' Cymbaline , '' '' `` '' Main Theme , '' '' and `` '' Quicksilver .

Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album , now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind. < br / > < br / > The plot of `` '' More '' '' is a little hard to take at times , especially in the early going , when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it . But eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer , as the plot becomes more focused . Why does Stefan take heroin ? Why does ANYBODY take heroin , fully knowing the possible consequences ? The film does not attempt to answer that question directly , but Stefan 's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure. < br / > < br / > I strongly recommend this film to any Pink Floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated `` '' More '' '' soundtrack . I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media .

You see , consciousness is a real challenge for him . Maintaining it , that is . He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead . This is part of the film 's problem . The nature of Howard 's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he 's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed , even in the year 1918 ( when the film is set ) . He ca n't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago . His violent , threatening , anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things ( a young girl flirting , inadequacies involving the war , due to his being rejected for service ) . I do n't know how he even made it past the interview with Helen . There are other implausibilities . If you were locked in your house with a madman , but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time , could n't you figure out a way to escape ? < br / > < br / > Ryan , I think , is defeated by the material . It feels like he 's overplaying his hand . His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there , done-that robotic feel to them . At this point in his career he 'd probably played this character , to some degree , ten times and it shows . We are encouraged to empathize with Howard ( I did n't ) through shown bits of humanity , like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who wo n't judge him . Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress , which she is more than capable of and does . < br / > < br / > The picture had one thing going for it ; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict ? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective . < br / > < br / > Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howard 's reflection ( in mirrors , water , Christmas tree decorations ) . This indicated something going on , or about to go on , in his head . Horner ( 1953 's Vicki ) , who made his reputation in production design , does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison . Credit too , the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house . In the end , sub-standard work from the principals , who all have much better films to their credit . < br / > < br / > *½ out of 4",0,negative

19985,"Fatal Contact : Bird Flu in America : 3 out of 10 : This movie is both funny and sad . The funny part is fairly obvious as this certainly is n't a sober look at a possible impending crisis . This is a modern version of The Swarm . And much like those killer bees ( and the so called killer bee crisis that prompted them ) Bird Flu has joined a pantheon of media inspired end of the world scenarios ( SARS , Y2K , Global Warming ) that simply refuse to actually come about. < br / > < br / > The sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic . Disease pandemics historically were fairly common after all people did n't all die in their forties from heart disease . Even recent pandemics such as AIDS mirrors the old fashioned VD crisis ( Think syphilis ) that used to kill more soldiers than bullets. < br / > < br / > The flu pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business killing millions but honestly life went on . I wonder if our over dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today. < br / > < br / > The movie itself swerves wildly from fairly competent scenes ( Triage in grand Central Station ) to the ridiculous ( Rednecks try to ambush national guardsman in Manhattan ) . < br / > < br / > The scenarios themselves are fairly useless as the filmmakers ca n't seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or for that matter whether the symptoms are an Ebola style crash or simply a long illness . Indeed one scene will show everyone in bio-hazard suits and the next will have nobody even wearing a mask. < br / > < br / > The film also patently refuses to actually give any practical advice regarding what to do in a Bird Flu crisis .

After reading the premise , I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential . Unfortunately , the film did n't live up to its potential although I should have expected this since the trailer was awful . The screenplay was probably the worst part about it . It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog . The characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them. < br / > < br / > The directors did a horrible job at building up suspense . They mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps . The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next `` '' scary '' '' moment . I also did n't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie . The house was the centerpiece of the story and that 's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area . Also , I did n't like the close-ups of the actors . During a conversation , the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying . The directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish . However , since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects , it 's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a Hollywood film. < br / > < br / > The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December , I 'm sure it would have received several Razzie nominations . Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room but you would n't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers . She was okay at acting scared and that 's it . The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing . Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything . It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I have ever seen . Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion . John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes . The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors .

I have seen movies make fun of themselves , but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors , awful props , and awful music to be taken seriously . I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie . How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled `` '' Generic Ninja Fight Scene , Op . 1 '' '' or `` '' Variations on A Bad Guy Pointing a Gun at a Girl 's Head When Backed into a Corner '' '' or the daring `` '' Flight of the Helicopter '' '' . Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled . Those actually had me in tears laughing .

The thing that really had me going though , was not the music ( which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from G.I . Joe to pop up ) , but the ending ...

11924,"I think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall . It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed . I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape . It did not happen in or around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall . The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time . The balloon took off from Pössneck , 170 miles south-west of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany . The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year . Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema , it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin , other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states .",1,positive

5496,"Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company , Filmation on the back of He-man : Masters of the universe and She-Ra : Princess of Power , in 1983 and 87 ' respectively . The plot of the cartoon was about a Native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr , who possesses the strength of the bear , ears of the wolf , speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk , and his trusty sidekick , a talking horse named Thirty- Thirty , who carried with him a gun aptly titled , 'Sarah Jane ' and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge J.B serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of outlaws. < br / > < br / > Set in futuristic Texas , this was and still is to this day , one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city , in the US- hence in the South- thousands of light years ahead in the future . Considering this was made in the 80s , the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a Sci-Fi based outlook . Bravestarr did n't just evoke morality and good verses bad , as well as teaching children lessons about life , but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we should n't take things and life for granted . And despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon , many of the story lines , themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them . In addition , Marshall Bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ( ethnic ) minority background , to make an impact on TV. < br / > < br / > The sound effects were amazing , the music was great , the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful . The characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong . Something of which the same can not be said about today 's cartoons , sadly. < br / > < br / > Whilst Bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of He-man , it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics . Suffice to say , I preferred Bravestarr over He-man because of the diversity of the story lines , characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves , were more what I would say realistic and identifiable in contrast . For some reason , they resonated more with people because like for instance , in 'The Pledge ' where a kid dies from a drug overdose , the fact that there was n't a happy ending was important- in the sense that when kids watch that episode , well , in fact anyone who watches that episode , will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. < br / > < br / > Bold , brave and at times thought-provoking , Bravestarr is definitely that- bold , brave and thought provoking . A cult cartoon classic for many years to come , it dared to take some risks , but it had well and truly paid off in the end . It will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever , and rightly so < br / > < br / > 8 and a half out of ten",1,positive

I have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie . I also learned that tough love can build a stronger person . Now I want to know where to find the movie soundtrack . There are songs in this soundtrack I have been trying to get for years . May I comment on the acting for a second . Jamie Fox was outstanding . The man has risen to be the actor of actors . Also the performance of Regina King was awesome . If I can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at Ray ... I can only dream . I plucked down $ 18.00 for this movie and I do n't have a lot of money but I am willing to see this movie again and again . This movie touched me .,1,positive
2009,"I hope the writer , director , editor , and composer ( and let 's not forget producer ) read this ... because their work was truly incredible on this movie . Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie . I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times. < br / > < br / > Every second of this movie is touching . Every scene is classic . The acting is real . The movie is honest . You can relate to these characters as people , not actors. < br / > < br / > This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives . The story is carefully thought out and every sub-plot is intertwined and woven together , culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside. < br / > < br / > Crispen Glover , Daniel Roebuck , Dennis Hopper , and Joshua John Miller ( as a 12 year old boy ) give absolutely amazing , real performances . I 've seen this movie about 8 or more times and I still get so absorbed in their performances that I forget I am watching a movie . It 's that good . Great job everyone who worked on this . Great job. < br / > < br / > The music is also wonderfully matched and haunting . With the chosen cast , the carefully timed editing and pacing , the mood and tone , and even the subject matter , the director made some of the best decisions for a movie I 've ever seen. < br / > < br / > This movie is real . It 's honest . It 's a true movie experience which I will never forget . You may not be into the subject matter but it is something you can not ignore . Ultimately , it 's about people being people ... and everyone can relate to that . I recommend this movie to fans of drama , suspense , and horror above almost every other film .",1,positive

259,"`` Well , this is about as good as they come . There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a `` '' master of commercial suspense '' '' or maybe a `` '' compulsive technician '' '' -- or was he really `` '' deep . '' '' Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean , but it 's legitimate to ask if , at his best , he could not have been all three things at once. < br / > < br / > In this one he seems to be about at his peak . Hardly anything in it is accidental . It abounds with doubt , ambiguity , and wit . And the story is engrossing , Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcock 's own. < br / > < br / > I 'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I wo n't bother going into it . I 'll just point out five on screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for. < br / > < br / > Bruno Antony ( Walker ) has followed Miriam ( Laura Miller ) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her . She 's noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it. < br / > < br / > 1 . Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake . Walker is right behind them , smiling , in his boat -- Pluto . `` `` Pluto . '' '' It 's not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character . It 's a reference to Pluto , also called Hades , a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology . This tiny touch ca n't be an accident . And the `` '' underworld '' '' that Walker represents is not just a literal hell , but the underworld of the human mind . I hate to say he 's a Jungian `` '' shadow '' '' but that 's what he is . ( Did Carl Jung see this movie ? He was alive at the time of its release -- but probably not . ) 2 . Now , this is a deadly serious sequence , right ? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he does n't even know . Imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors . A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival , stealing from shadow to shadow , the killer peering from behind the canvas walls , and so forth . What does Hitchcock show us ? When Walker first comes through the gates , concentrating on his victim , a little boy in a cowboy suit , holding a balloon , runs up and shouts , `` '' Bang ! Bang ! You 're dead ! '' '' Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid . And when the kid starts to walk away , Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it , then continues his pursuit without another glance . That 's one way Hitchcock treats impending doom. < br / > < br / > 3 . The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses , which has been aped innumerable times. < br / > < br / > 4 . Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet , sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow . One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck does n't reach the bell at the top . Under Miriam 's delighted and admiring gaze , Walker smiles and rubs his hands together , then picks up the mallet , slams it down , and the puck bangs against the bell . She 's thrilled . He puts the mallet down , looks at her , grins , and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff ! 5 . After the discovery of Miriam 's body , while whistles blow and people shout , Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb . Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection , gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic . A macabre joke. < br / > < br / > These incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit . ( Robert Walker 's performance is exceptional throughout . ) It 's essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish . ( Cf : `` '' Ride the Pink Horse '' '' ) But the menace of the scene is undercut by Hitchcock 's insistence on irony and distance . None of the familiar noir techniques are employed . There 's nothing really `` '' creepy '' '' about it . And the murder itself is hardly a savage one . I do n't think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did . It would have been all menace and shadows , hiding places , abortive attempts , scowls instead of grins. < br / > < br / > Not that it 's an entirely flawless movie . A flawless movie is not yet with us . Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley Granger , although a nice guy , is stolid , dull , and rather stupid . His new girl friend is just dull. < br / > < br / > Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in `` '' The Wrong Man . '' '' I 'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt . The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education . `` `` Original sin '' '' -- you 're BORN with it -- and all that . In filmed interviews , he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo . We 're justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a `` '' screen memory . '' '' I hope you get the pun . I know , I know . It 's strained and inept but I spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up . ''",1,positive

As the back of the plane splits off , you can see the model is hollow as it `` '' breaks away '' '' in the phony snow . Most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play , as the `` '' sounds '' '' of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene. < br / > < br / > '' '' But how what will they eat ? They have no food '' '' one military person ( It 's never clear what this guy does or why he 's in charge ) says , which I 'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food , since they were concerned if the people were alive , not how they 'd eat . It was simply a stupid line written to point out that , yes , they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive. < br / > < br / > When they finally decide to eat the bodies , one man finds one shirtless body , who despite being in the snow for however long , is not remotely frozen , in fact , his flesh is very flexible and fresh . He cuts the fresh meat off his back , that again , is not frozen or even cold it appears , and this scene goes on for five minutes . That 's where I had to stop . The remake `` '' Alive '' '' was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that I 'm sure the real survivors praised whereas I ca n't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version . It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary . Avoid . ''",0,negative

8010,"Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is . In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. < br / > < br / > In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie ( yes even better then Dark Knight ) . Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman , which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he 's up against . First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin . Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman , who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies . I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end . Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken . While in a supporting role there 's something about this role that I love and maybe it 's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is. < br / > < br / > Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman . Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson 's over the top antics . You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city . Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona . When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he 's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time. < br / > < br / > Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that 's taking place within it . Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns. < br / > < br / > So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger 's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something . Batman Returns lacks nothing , so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for .",1,positive
5929,"The Ascent ( 1977 ) < br / > < br / > Larisa Shepitko is a name very few are familiar with . Her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade , ended abruptly by a tragic car accident . Despite her short career , she however managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her time . Her last film , The Ascent , is widely regarded as one of the finest Soviet films of the 1970s . Nevertheless , her work remained in obscurity throughout the years that followed , usually only available on rare and poor copies on video . That has now changed thanks to the folks at Criterion . They 've released two of Shepitko 's best works through their Eclipse department - Wings , and her penultimate masterpiece The Ascent. < br / > < br / > Set during the darkest days of WWII in snowy rural Russia , two partisans trudge their way across the land in search of food after their party is attacked by Nazi patrols . They 're originally only to go to a nearby farm , but when they arrive they find it razed by the Germans . Not wanting to return empty handed , they continue on deeper into enemy territory . Along the way they must confront not only enemy soldiers , but the harsh conditions of the Russian plains , potential betrayal and their own souls. < br / > < br / > The movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or destinations . It addresses difficult questions with painful rationality . It never takes the easy road or gives us comforting answers . The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas . Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between fellow Russians - those who collaborated and those who fought back . While she does show the collaborators as the clear heels , she nevertheless also shows why many turned to such tactics - survival. < br / > < br / > The film contains a number of religious references , particularly to the lead up to the crucifixion . This is a spiritual journey , into the hearts , souls , and minds of the two partisans and those they encounter . Shepitko and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography . The camera moves in long shots , similar to the camera-work of another of Russia 's greatest filmmakers , Andrei Tarkovsky . Shepitko , like many others , was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky 's style , and the Ascent takes some of its rhythmic notes from Ivan 's Childhood . It is a stunning film to look at , and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. < br / > < br / > Shepitko 's husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later . Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest films I 've ever seen - Come and See . The story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by The Ascent . Though that film is also a fairly obscure one , it received far more attention that any of Shepitko 's films . That however acted as a bridge to Shepitko , and has been one of the best helps to keeping her work alive. < br / > < br / > The Ascent is a truly magnificent film , and rightly should be considered one of the best films of the 70s . It 's stunning cinematography is inspiring ; its mood is frighteningly authentic ; and its lessons are unforgettable . It is , in any definition of the word , nothing less than a masterpiece . How unfortunate that Shepitko 's career was cut short just as it was hitting its peak .",1,positive
10063,"`` When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland , `` '' They Died With Their Boots On '' '' ( 1941 ) is most likely the film remembered best . It is the sweeping saga of General Custer ( Flynn ) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious Elizabeth Bacon ( DeHavilland ) , through his tenure during the American Civil War , and finally with his death at Little Big Horn . Director , Raoul Walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts , rewritten by screen writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie , until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion . Hence , the battle against Chief Crazy Horse ( Anthony Quinn ) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe ( Charley Grapewin ) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation 's first peoples . < br / > < br / > Flynn , who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer , has never been more ignoble . He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine . Resident Warner stock players , Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them. < br / > < br / > Overall , then , despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn , `` '' They Died With Their Boots On '' '' is ample film fodder for a Saturday matinée or Sunday night cooing with one 's sweetheart . Warner 's DVD is pretty nice looking . Although film grain is often obvious , the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep , solid blacks and very clean whites . Some fading is obvious during scene transitions . The audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level . ''",1,positive
2136,"this is film is probably one of the best i 've seen so far . i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes ... . ' 9 souls ' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School . they later find out that there was n't much there and set off on their own ways . the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated . it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey . the second half , moved me to tears . as the movie progresses , each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams , but unfortunately ending somewhat badly . in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left . the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes . a beautiful film directed fantastically . this is a movie for people who have enjoyed Toshiaki Toyoda 's other films such as 'Blue Spring ' .",1,positive
20853,This film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it I recommend watching it back to back with Rosemary 's Baby. < br / > < br / > There is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters . Observe Minnie Castevet ( Ruth Gordon ) and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film. < br / > < br / > It is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors . Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch Rosemary 's Baby before making this ? < br / > < br / > If your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one . I have a lot more to say about this film but I really do n't want to go there .,0,negative

Talking To Americans was such a funny special too . But like my friend said `` '' Rick Mercer woke up one day and was n't funny any more '' '' I think that day was when Rick Mercer Report went on the air . What is the point of this show ? Rick Mercer reads wacky fake headlines , shows pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on TV and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh . We 're supposed to be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves , and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be `` '' funny '' '' . Rick Mercer got old or just lost interest or just ai n't funny any more . Even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor .

13019,"`` This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas , they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one . Now do n't get me wrong , I absolutely love the first Beastmaster ; I even liked the third one pretty good , but this movie is atrocious . I am a huge fantasy/sword & sorcery movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster . So why do I hate this movie so much ? Well , where do I begin ? First of all , the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous . Dar and his evil older brother Arklon ( who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie..Huh ? ) cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time-portal gate . Ya see , Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dar 's world . Whereas with the first movie , you 're led to think the movie just takes place in the past , but with this one you 're shown it 's a completely whole other world altogether ... that 's just one of the many things I hated about this sequel . It did n't work with `` '' Masters of the Universe '' '' , and it sure does n't work here either ! Movies like this should take place and stay in their own time-line and their usual surroundings . For Christ 's sake , what 's next ? Hercules in New York ... er , uh..bad example ! Moving on ... < br / > < br / > Arklon 's after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom . So , it 's up to Dar , his ferrets , his eagle , and his tiger ( not a spray-painted one this time ) to go off and save the world ... but along the way they have the help of a young , cool , and hip Senator 's daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show 's Dar around L.A. , takes him for a joyride in her BMW , and helps get him out of tight situations here and there . How convenient right ? And speaking of convenient , I found it awfully convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen , highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half the U.S. Army and L.A.P.D . after him ... .waaaaay to easy , even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world . There are sooo many plot holes in this I do n't know where to begin ; like why did Arklon go to the L.A. zoo for at the end of the movie ? ! ? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there ; and would n't that be like the last place you 'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS ? < br / > < br / > And do n't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy , they still do n't manage to hit him ? The police in this movie belong in the `` '' Police Academy '' '' series ! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind ! Even the title of the movie makes no sense : `` '' Beastmaster 2 : Through the Portal of Time '' '' ... they never actually went through a `` '' time '' '' portal because the movie is n't set in the future of Dar 's world , it 's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane , so they NEVER actually go through time , only a dimensional world along theirs ; so NO actual time-travel is involved at all ! This movie tries to come off as funny and it does ... not because of the humor , but because it 's just so bad ... and that 's putting it mildly . The acting , dialogue , plot , characters , and ending are all so cheesy it 's hilarious . What more can I expect from the guy that brought us `` '' Return of the Swampthing '' '' ( another bad sequel ) ? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarelli 's wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one ! !

4157,"`` Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years . It was Respiro ( see comments and synopsis here in IMDb ) . < br / > < br / > Now , carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then , he takes the audience into a dark void . A literal plunge into dangerous waters . The subject is migration . In this case , from Italy to the New World ( the name of the film ) . A big deal calling it for its American release `` '' The Golden Door '' '' . < br / > < br / > The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest -that is , their lives , for a dream. < br / > < br / > I hate to spoil the show telling the story , so I 'll dwell a bit in the work Crialese and all his team did so brilliantly. < br / > < br / > First of all , choosing to stick to what he knows : direct sound as much as possible . This means , the whole film . The textures , the pain , the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells , the heat or the cold , the sweat and the blood , life and death , as vibrantly as it is in real life. < br / > < br / > The squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood , the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving. < br / > < br / > Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier . The symbolism of light is present from the very first shot ( again , almost the very first shot from Respiro ) and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation . The subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising. < br / > < br / > Light is used sparsely , almost to discover every character in the dark . The beauty of every shot , and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors. < br / > < br / > Again , as he usually does , Vincenzo Amato is definitely on his own . He plays the father of two sons ( the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen ) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters. < br / > < br / > Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so . I guess she 's never achieved again the perfection she reached in The Cement Garden and in her very first film : L'Effrontée. < br / > < br / > Maybe it 's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role. < br / > < br / > The locations and sets are harsh and compelling , almost playing a character on their own. < br / > < br / > Maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo , the mute younger son . The contrast here with his first role is complete . Then , he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him . Now , his character is all expression . And just that : no words at all . His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. < br / > < br / > Maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the States . It 's absolutely Italian in everything . It 's so Italian that most of the time , the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than Italian itself . In the USA this film may be a bit too much for Americans because of the subject . But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the States , will see this films with awe. < br / > < br / > And , again , the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese 's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water . Only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial. < br / > < br / > All in all , another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year ( 2006 ) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the Golden Lion .

8757,"`` I consider Saboteur as Hitchcock 's first `` '' American '' '' film , because the story takes place completely in U.S. < br / > < br / > There are brilliant scenes in this film . Statue of Liberty Scene , Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge , Water fall scene are amazing . Its not Hitchcock 's fault that he did n't get the actors he wanted . Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur . But Gary Cooper was n't interested in doing a thriller . Another reason why Hitchcock did n't get big stars was because he was n't one of top directors . Although Rebecca was a huge success , still most of film 's success went to Producer David O. Selznick . For Example , David O. Selznick got Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca . And Hitchcock did n't get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca . Hitchcock started getting some attention after Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) . But Universal gave him a low-budget for Saboteur ( 1942 ) . Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this film , because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary . He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) . But he was unavailable . So the role went to Robert Cummings . Hitchcock called Robert Cummings `` '' a competent performer . '' '' I thought he did his best . He was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role. < br / > < br / > As for leading female role , Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the leading role . They were n't interested either . So Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane . I read in a book that this was one of her favorite films. < br / > < br / > I also liked the scene at Blind Man 's house . That is my favorite scene . If we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in Uncle Philip 's house , then we will see how intense it is . Uncle Philip ( Blind Man ) was studying Barry Kane 's character the moment he entered his house . The moment Barry entered his house , he heard Barry 's handcuffs . Through conversation , he realized that Barry Kane is n't a criminal at all . We also see his hearing ability through those scenes . For Example , Barry hears the sound of a car says `` '' Is that a car coming ? '' '' Uncle Philip says `` '' 2 cars I think . '' '' Uncle Philip was right . We see 2 cars in the next scene . Priscilla Lane did a fine job playing her role . She was no big star . But I thought her performance was really good . Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philip 's house is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane ( Patricia Martin ) `` '' Are you frightened , Pat ? Is that what makes you so cruel ? '' '' I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly . Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain . But he refused . Harry Carey is famous for his role Mr. President in `` '' Mr. Smith goes to Washington . '' '' I want to mention more about this film . But I think my post is getting too long. < br / > < br / > Every Hitchcock film is special in its own way . I am sure Hitchcock fans will like this film . I rate 10 out of 10 . ''",1,positive

The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could . It was a waste of talent , film , their time , and mine .

3265,"This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross , Sydney . The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who 's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss . Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown . The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist . The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done . Eg . When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun . I personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies , and in this regard , the movie did not offend . It attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as Bryan Brown . The rest of the cast did an OK job , without any real stand-outs that I remember . The direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment . The main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification , thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake . The director , Gregor Jordan , deserves special mention . Rating in my book - 7 ( of 10 ) .",1,positive

6561,"`` My skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-by-four skateboard with steel roller-skate wheels hit a rock and I tumbled , for days it seemed , down the sidewalk outside my parent 's house in Boston . By the time the cast came off my arm , summer was gone. < br / > < br / > But I have always admired the X-games types and surfers especially . I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California on the beaches and piers watching the surfers , bemoaning that fact that I had missed my calling . It 's the sort of thing you should learn young , before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in . Or else at best , you 'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at , you 'll wind up looking like a trained bear. < br / > < br / > I always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment , that wave , that experience . At one with the forces of nature . A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there , and the way you interact with it . There 's a lot of Zen in it to me. < br / > < br / > This documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding . Ramps , downgrades , low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet . In their day and time , this was all new . radical . Prior to the Zephyr Skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard , hence my long `` '' Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace '' '' like tumble down the front walk. < br / > < br / > This film is a look back through time , to an America before EVERYTHING was labeled , tagged , marketed , and jam-forced down our throats as `` '' Extreme '' '' . ( Seriously , what 's so `` '' extreme '' '' about an `` '' Extreme value meal '' '' at Taco Bell ? Other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon ... ) < br / > < br / > Watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports ' . Before there was an X-games , before Boom-boom Huck-Jam , before Crusty Demons , before the ASA ... there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports ' without really trying . They were just doing it for the purity , the pure pleasure , of skateboarding in the sun with friends . < br / > < br / > I hope they get a cut of the 'extreme ' money out there . Goodness knows they do n't get the credit they deserve . Maybe this film can correct that. < br / > < br / > Excellent film with a great soundtrack , a portrait of a Southern California , indeed an America , that no longer exists. < br / > < br / > I do n't care for Sean Penn but he does a decent job narrating .

16276,"Veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills . In fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs , quite a few here to be honest , scattered in the whole process , thanks to Depardieu 's half-wit characterization and the dialogue Veber puts in his mouth. < br / > < br / > But this is not enough to make a great comedy since there 's no movie outside of the usual Veber premise : a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character . In L'Emmerdeur , La Chèvre or Les Compères there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings . Le Diner de cons , although it was a play , managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe Pinon would cause . In Tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest . Plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script. < br / > < br / > Now what 's wrong ? Veber wraps this up creating no action , no rhythm . Instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses ( maybe he met William Goldman in Hollywood ) and the 'music ' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story. < br / > < br / > So you 'll have to be content with Depardieu 's performance .",0,negative
15832,"`` I managed to see this at what I think was the second screening in the world , a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival . While I was attending another film two nights later at the same theater , I saw Brendan Gleeson , Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of Studs. < br / > < br / > I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film , I was by no means expecting a masterpiece , but what was presented to me , I believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into . Before I continue , two things , I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations , here this is simply not the case . Secondly , I know that it was based on a play ( which I have n't read but have been informed that it is n't a shimmering piece of literature ) , but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. < br / > < br / > My main problem with the film is the script , forget that it was based on a play , as a sports comedy it simply does n't work , the down and out team are trying to win a football cup , few of the games are shown ( when they are , it is very short ) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements . Having read so far , you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a `` '' charlatan '' '' of a manager and his hopeless team . It certainly does not achieve this , I 'm not even sure if it was aiming to . Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral . Overall , I found the script lacking in many respects. < br / > < br / > I do think the performances and the music were good and technically , the film was well made . But aside from those points , which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage , I left the theater feeling very disappointed. < br / > < br / > My judgment may seem harsh but I do think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument . As Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld film ( I was part of the audience at that screening ) , most people would seem to be disagreeing with me , so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film .

I was there . I wanted to believe , believe that I 'd see the next great Mormon movie , one that would hold the Numero Uno spot for a very long time . But no . Three-fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that I never wanted to go through . He takes on the Mt .

I know Dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so , but I was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing , no thing , could have brought me back . The preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes did n't help . Anyone who 's been on a mission knows what I 'm talking about , especially anyone whoSpoiler Alertis familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and/or psychological reasons . It 's as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly do n't apply. < br / > < br / > There are a million things good about this film , but they were created and beautified only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a knee-jerk fit of `` '' ooh , this will really get them '' '' elitism .

While he does very little and loses at that , he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot . While his love-interest says and does a lot , her actions display very little thought behind it . In my humble opinion. < br / > < br / > All in all , a very disturbing film that is not made for action , which is n't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days ; it 's magnificent , and repellant at the same time .

24465,"`` Jerk hazer Mike ( David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away ) and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam ( Caleb Roehrig ) hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story . They get PO 'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty ( Kristina Sheldon ) instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment . Somehow , Sam 's soul `` '' emerges '' '' with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot . Mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks back to bring Sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats . Mike and his posse head for the beach to gulp booze , play volleyball & bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little soirée . Sam 's substitute brother Jack ( Matthew Linhardt ) is supposed to look out for him , but decides to sleep with new love-interest Beth ( Samantha Aisling ) instead . So when he receives a cell-phone message from Mike concerning how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand , Jack is frenzied with fear . Beth 's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after Sam 's condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to emergency hospital . Returning to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence ( ..not to mention Jack 's promise to coach Ramsey , played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock , regarding no hazing ) , Jack and Beth will face the same straw-stuffed assassin that is bumping off the others . Coach Ramsey , who was part of a past hazing incident that went awry causing killer-scarecrow-mischief , has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against. < br / > < br / > Babes , boobs , and blood..this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines . Yet , this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters , acting , dialogue and overall plot . The flick shows signs of it 's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off-screen instead of showing it happening up , close & personal . What appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer 's vengeance : one fellow holding his guts , another with a stake ( holding up the group 's volleyball net ) plunged through his chest , blood spatter after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock , one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV , etc . There is also some dubbing problems where it 's clear the sounds of their voices often do n't match the movements of their lips..particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where Ed ( Travis Parker ) , wannabe rock star , is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with .

18638,"`` `` '' Clubbed '' '' is yet another 'will-this-do ? ' entry into the Brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who are n't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers . However , for anyone seeking intelligent , quality entertainment it 's really best avoided. < br / > < br / > There are so many misnomers in the appalling script that even an actor of the calibre of Colin Salmon is left looking daft . The action is set in the 1980s , but it 's never clear why , especially when they have n't been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack , the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30-year-old cars . Then we see central characters studying texts such as Sun Tzu 's `` '' The Art Of War '' '' and speaking about how violence should be a last resort , while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone-fuelled , unthinking abandon of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips. < br / > < br / > Character development does not exist in `` '' Clubbed '' '' . Nor does irony , subtlety or pathos . This is a film which trades on fond memories of Guy Richie 's early gangster films , which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit , better editing , snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga .

9355,"I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema . The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it , I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon 's Dorm Daze . I liked that movie , aside from having a huge collection of such genres , I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser. < br / > < br / > Delightfully , I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie . Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham . Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life , coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to . This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time . The only way of pulling it off is through this movie. < br / > < br / > The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner , the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors . I 'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and do n't worry , you will get laughs throughout the movie . It is a definite guarantee .",1,positive

Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters .

The hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but I wanted something else to happen . Perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret .

8029,"This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities to Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there is some other very similar action movies , but this film has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire ( that 's right , the Jackie Chan 's movie ) . Rarely American action movies has such a great action sequences , though there was many negative reviews on this film , it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful . There were many martial art 's scenes , David Bradley was fast as Bruce Lee in this film and what else was good , that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the American martial art 's movies . The shoot-out scenes were similar with John Woo 's movies , maybe not that good , but still very exiting . There was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene . I 've seen some other David Bradley 's movies , but this one , yet is the best in terms of action . OK , this movie has some cheesy moments , but which movie has n't ? The acting was decent , Charles Napier was incredible and his character was real tough . Adam Clark who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto who played the main bad guy were also very good .

23261,"This film is so bad it 's hilarious . I watched Hell Ride half thinking it was a comedy , although I could n't quite work out if they were actually taking the p*ss , or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent . I notice it is n't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious ! It 's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine . One scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads , then showing each other 'get out of jail free ' cards that they 've made ! Also check out Vinnie Jones ' accent , where the hell is he meant to be from ? ! ? Oh and there 's a load of naked girls in it too , who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards ! The guy who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000 'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role , maybe this is part of the joke , I do n't know . Actually , the more I think about it the more I 'm sure this film is a p*ss take . It 's produced by Quentin Tarantino and it 's possible he 's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh . It is a total rip off of Tarantino 's style , but just done really really badly . It is very amusing though , and I guess either way it could go down as a cult classic , either from being an amusing parody of the Tarantino/Rodriguez style , or something that is very very unintentionally funny .

11753,"First off , let it be known that I came into this movie not for the music ; actually I find it repugnant . Really , I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture . On this point , the documentary did fairly well . One disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped-up band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok . If you 've seen the first such scene , you 've seen them all . This superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs . With these , the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band . The lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers . I do n't know why all the lyrics were not printed . Scenes without lyrics slow ( ironic eh ? , given the many references to the speed of the music ) the flow of the movie . Also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands , though there is a letdown when the latter band 's interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two . Overall , a good movie that I 'm glad I saw . I 'll check out the follow-ups if I ever get a chance. < br / > < br / > Favorite quote : He tried to hide the fact that he could n't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass . < br / > < br / > Broad punk generalization : Though their disgracefulness , lack of vocabulary and hygiene , and drug-induced obliviousness is often hilarious , in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize ( disregarding Black Flag , who are slightly less misguided than their peers ) .",1,positive

Why do they bother at all ? The first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase was brilliant and hilarious . This is not . They rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence , and a character called Uncle Nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women .

1972,"`` Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor , and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed . But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely. < br / > < br / > The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in . The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in . Existenz is not an action movie at all , and is not ( as many seem to believe ) about `` '' reality '' '' or any such `` '' deep '' '' concept . It 's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial ( both in its origin and in its behavior ) world of make-believe. < br / > < br / > The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her `` '' scripted '' '' line . It 's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story . This is made even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader ( or rather his player ) comments on the possibility of spending one 's life in the game . I sympathize completely with the `` '' realist '' '' philosophy , that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence . Living `` '' in the game '' '' is not living at all , but is a tempting way to spend one 's time on earth . As Allegra comments about the real world , `` '' there 's nothing going on here . '' '' Might as well jack into someone else 's imagination , and pretend to be doing something interesting . ( Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment , considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets . ) < br / > < br / > Upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie , I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended . But having seen it a couple more times ( thank you SciFi Channel ) I 've realized how much deeper it goes . Seriously , if you 've only seen it once , it deserves another viewing . ''",1,positive
4564,"`` This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days . This is also my first comment of one I 've seen previously though it 's been about 24 years since then , so I did n't remember much of it . In this one , the Honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the Big Apple ... This is the best of the Chan entries I 've seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected ( though , of course , if I look at them at closer examination , there could still be some holes though I ca n't think of any right now ) . And `` '' No . 2 Son '' '' Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung ) is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on , though , of course , he blunders a little later . Among the returning supporting cast from the last Chan film-Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum-are blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone , who 's brother John G. helmed a lost Chan one called Charlie Chan 's Chance , as a fingerprint expert . Nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane . Oh , and watch for a certain Stooge at a police line up ... ''",1,positive

4950,"`` `` '' Four Daughters '' '' begins as just another clone of `` '' Little Women '' '' type melodrama . A single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals . What turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star , some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean graced the big screen . From the time the dark , foreboding figure of Mickey Borden ( John Garfield ) appears at Ann Lemp 's ( Priscilla Lane ) gate splashing his self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast , `` '' Four Daughters '' '' becomes much more than just a chick flick. < br / > < br / > Though Garfield is the main reason to watch `` '' Four Daughters , '' '' there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy . Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz , later responsible for such gems as `` '' Casablanca '' '' and `` '' Mildred Pierce , '' '' pinpoints certain images with his camera ( aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller of `` '' Rebel Without A Cause '' '' fame ) that sticks in the viewers mind , for example the screeching gate that Ann 's first suitor , Felix Deitz ( Jeffrey Lynn ) , swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use it. < br / > < br / > That Garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious , but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way . The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role to perfection , as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished Ann never falters even when she 's with another man . Claude Rains , somewhat miscast as the father of the four coming-of-age young women , gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle . The three Lane Sisters , already famous for their musical abilities , turn into accomplished actresses , playing their parts well . A raft of supporting actors , including Dick Foran , Frank McHugh , May Robson , and Eddie Acuff , makes it all believable. < br / > < br / > How opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewer 's imagination . Ann is the eternal optimist , even when she and Mickey are down and out . She always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days , she saw prosperity just around the corner . Mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from Ann , which Ann refuses to do . Mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life . Mickey has meager talent as a composer ; Ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician . Ann is big on beauty ; Mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way . And the differences go on and on . How all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie , not to be missed. < br / > < br / > See `` '' Four Daughters '' '' for John Garfield 's doozy of an acting debut on the big screen . The only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever , as Frank Chambers in `` '' The Postman Always Rings Twice , '' '' opposite the equally charismatic Lana Turner . But also watch `` '' Four Daughters '' '' to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show . ''",1,positive
13199,"Rose  Does anything actually happen in this episode ? It introduces our two leads , a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly un-interesting companion . There 's no plot to speak of , childish humour , mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music . What else is there to say , really ? < br / > < br / > The End of the World  A marginal improvement , in that we see our first outer-space scenario . Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour , paper-thin logic , very poor pacing , and tired SF clichés. < br / > < br / > The Unquiet Dead  Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode , write interesting character dialogue , AND integrate an intriguing plot . Let down solely by the Doctor and Rose. < br / > < br / > Aliens of London/World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce . What more can be said . Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity , trying her best in dire circumstances . Some poorly written , and out-of-place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes , and a return to poor pacing , bad plotting and cringe worthy humour/satire. < br / > < br / > Dalek  Not great , however still far above the RTD fare to date . The pacing and script are all fine ( though the Doctor and Rose still irritate ) . The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well . The finale , however , took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor 's most notorious foe , into a cuddly touchy-feely mess , and turning a previously un-seen menace , to a blue rubber squid that looked like a child 's toy. < br / > < br / > The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot , even if it was in a clichéd 80s style . Still , it was marred somewhat by his usual over-reliance on juvenile jokes , placing it too far in the future to make logical sense , and again poor pacing . Not as bad as his previous efforts , but instantly forgettable. < br / > < br / > Father 's Day  The initial premise could 've been vaguely interesting , but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning . Also , we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera . Before you start thinking this is all about characterization , remember , there 's a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization . On the plus side , it does prove RTD is n't the worst script writer so far. < br / > < br / > The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way , with some cringe worthy moments , and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil would n't make ( Well lit windows in a blackout , anyone ? ) . After this , the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn . Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes , showing us what an interesting companion could 've been like . She could also act . Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion . The conclusion was a little hasty , but sufficient . The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline , making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing . < br / > < br / > Boom Town - I have to be honest , except for a few examples , I had been so disillusioned by the current series , that upon seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen ' episode , I gave up and did n't subject myself to the torture. < br / > < br / > Bad Wolf - Reality TV , arguably the worst facet of the modern media , is basically used as the premise . There 's no subtlety whatsoever . Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show ? No , of course not . This in an RTD episode , so they 're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows . Once again , logic goes out the window , as we 're placed 200,000-something years in the future . RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some 'over-arcing ' story here , with no relevance other than it 's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats , and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax ! Faster paced for the most part , than RTD 's other efforts , this has one or two interesting moments . Otherwise , another lacklustre instalment. < br / > < br / > The Parting of the Ways - The big finale . More of a damp squid , literally . All of the Dalek menace set up in 'Dalek ' is brought crashing down , as they become rather pathetic . So many plot holes riddle this episode , with typically poor contrivances . Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks , but then vaporize entire continents ? Dalek 's can vaporize said continents , but not destroy the Tardis in space ? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere , even over people so they can be saved in it ? This ability ca n't be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god ' ? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents , but do n't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor , and instead let him play around ? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions , after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks ? These and many other holes aside , we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived , joined with a near pointless story arc. < br / > < br / > So what can we say about the new series , all-in-all ? < br / > < br / > Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who , with RTD behind it ? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable , if they were anything other than Doctor Who , and had RTD 's name attached ? I think not. < br / > < br / > Some people would have us think we ca n't say anything against RTD , since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens . However , this at the expense of good characters and stories . Personally , I 'd rather not have a poorly planned , ill conceived product , churned out at that price . I 'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort . For the most part , this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name , marring what is otherwise the most creative genre .",0,negative

I 've been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the Westerns from the 1960s ( even though I was too young to have seen them in their first run ) . The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music . It was distracting at times . One thing I did notice , and I wonder how many other fans of Gunsmoke noticed , was the name of Buck Taylor 's character . It was a play on Doc Adams ' name from Gunsmoke . Instead of Gaylan Adams , Buck Taylor used Adam Galen . I wonder if that was his choice or Chris McIntyre 's ? Anyway , I would recommend this movie to fans of Westerns .

Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying ... as for the plot I completely forgot . Who cares it sucked anyway . i 'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying . do n't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... the jokes are so unkiddy it 's funny,0,negative

4579,"I have read both the book and saw the movie today . The storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it . So nothing much there . However , this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel , just like the book . Watching it is not like watching a documentary on a failed state and feeling sympathetic towards people suffering under an oppressive regime , but is like watching any other common man 's story unfold , across generations , across continents . Amir 's cowardice , his guilt , his dilemmas and finally his choosing a way of redemption could have been a story of any of us . There is n't a single infallible character to look up to and idolize but all of them are gray , just like all of us. < br / > < br / > Another important observation is that the movie does a great job of chronicling the lives of Afghans through the twenty some years of turbulent political scenarios . The vibrant , care-free childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate , shattered remains of the city echo what the Taliban has done to it. < br / > < br / > The child actors deserve 'thumbs up ' all the way . They can put any matured actor to shame. < br / > < br / > If you have not yet seen the movie or read the book , just walk into the theater keeping in mind that you are going to witness a multi-layered story woven on a multi-colored fabric of human emotions and sentiments . This movie is not meant to stir anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings but to feel the trials of human existence. < br / > < br / > I read some of the external reviews linked to the site and I must confess I do not see the point in writing reviews that summarize the storyline like a distant spectator and point out technical details about amazing cinematography or something similar . At least for this movie , one should try to connect to it rather than judging it objectively .",1,positive
2209,"Actor turned director Liev Schreiber ( The Sum of All Fears ) does an above average screen version of the novel , Everything Is Illuminated , by author Jonathan Safran Foer . This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul. < br / > < br / > Jonathan Foer ( Elijah Wood ) is a young man who has seen his grandfather , Safran , pass away . Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life 's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall . Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago . Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive . He enlists the help of a brash , young tour guide named Alex ( Eugene Hutz ) and his grandfather ( Boris Leskin ) to drive him to his goal . At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads , but as the group nears its target , the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town . There , they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn. < br / > < br / > This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors . At times , the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film . The title itself is a play on self discovery . This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past , and his past ironically involves his companions ; Jonathan 's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well . It 's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime . By the end of the film , these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives . It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul . It 's also about one 's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past . Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light . Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film 's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told. < br / > < br / > The story is deceptively simple . It functions as a road trip movie ( like The Straight Story ) combined with an interesting mystery story . It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present . The ending is a bit surreal with its déjà vu feeling. < br / > < br / > Elijah Wood ( Sin City , The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) ) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy . Here , he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show . Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively . Even the grandfather 's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. ( that 's right ) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion. < br / > < br / > The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film . The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly . The cinematography by Matthew Libatique ( Gothika , Requiem for a Dream ) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath. < br / > < br / > The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental . We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex 's grandfather and what his motivations are . Likewise , Jonathan 's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man . At times , the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed . But these are minor criticisms of what is a good , introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure . That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future .",1,positive

5114,"There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb . I think this is for three reasons . First , purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book .

That 's just the way it is . Lonesome Dove was n't as good as the novel it was based on . Additionally , the movie of Lonesome Dove had some things left out ans switched around . That 's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything .

After watching this I was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie . It must have been produced on a budget of pocket change .

5053,"`` When going to see Rendition , I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors . I was not expecting a film that was so engrossing , exciting , poetic , and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and did n't let me go , even after I left the theater . A word of advice to anyone who has n't seen it yet , do n't let your politics come in the way of enjoying ( or not enjoying ) this film . Take it for what it is . I saw this with my conservative Jewish family ( I 'm the black sheep , the pseudo-liberal college student ) and I thought they would write it off as `` '' liberal propaganda '' '' . Instead , they said it was a great film with excellent performances ( they like to fancy themselves film critics ) . < br / > < br / > It 's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors , while leaving out the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent Metwally . The entire cast gave good performances , with some standing out much more than others ; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which did n't allow for much screen time for each of the characters . In fact , I felt like the `` '' sub-plot '' '' with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on screen as Anwar 's part of the story. < br / > < br / > The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes , but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have . Streep is truly terrific , as a heartless senator , and as much as I do n't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her . Gyllenhaal , who will probably be one of the Oscar nods for this movie , seems a bit unsure in his role at times . H 's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he does n't know how he should feel . Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance ; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie . Metwally , again , was terrific , and I hope to see him in more mainstream films . It 's a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him . Yigal Naor , as shown on IMDb , has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes . He , along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach , all gave great performances. < br / > < br / > The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in commercials , but it brings a sad humanity to the story . The narrative was interesting as I was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end . I 've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless , but I disagree . I think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general . Khalid was the real terrorist , but he was doing it to avenge his brother , and even though he is responsible for the attack , you see a humane side to him through the story with Fatima . Not that I think we should feel bad for actual terrorists , but I think the `` '' we are all people '' '' theme was definitely relevant. < br / > < br / > Whatever your feelings on terrorism , politics , etc . leave it out of the theater . The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear . ''",1,positive

11921,"The movie Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89 . I lived in West Berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through The Wall into East Berlin on a weekly basis . Why ? Excitement , crossing a border into a Soviet governed country , experiencing the smells and the feel of East Germany , which is why Night Crossing is excellent , it captures that very feeling , and it is exciting . I was arrested by the Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses I am led to believe was Stasi . When I watch the movie I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil , I can see the outdated vehicles , the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows . It brings back memories of realising just how lucky I was to live in a free country . In 1988 , I toured the DDR from East to West , North to South . East Germany had changed little since 1967 . The Trabants , constantly breaking down , were still the main mode of private motorised transport , the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me , uniforms were still commonplace , but the people , the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust .

1743,"`` Harry Langdon 's `` '' Saturday Afternoon '' '' is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies , at least where short subjects are concerned , and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some . Unlike some of the other recognized classics such as Keaton 's `` '' Cops '' '' or Chaplin 's `` '' The Immigrant '' '' this film is in some respects a familiar , conventional situation comedy and does n't offer much in the way of belly laughs ; one may even wonder whether Langdon belongs in such rarefied company . Nonetheless , in my opinion , it 's a perfectly charming comedy in its minor-key way , and Harry is fascinating to watch. < br / > < br / > For a modern viewer raised on TV sitcoms the plot of `` '' Saturday Afternoon '' '' may suggest The Honeymooners or its many spin-offs : two dim guys , one of whom is married and very much under his wife 's thumb , try to sneak out with a couple of good-time girls for a fun afternoon ; but everything goes wrong , and they wind up having to fight the girls ' tough guy boyfriends . Does this sound familiar ? And perhaps a little dreary ? Well , the premise was already shopworn when this film was made , but beyond that nothing about Langdon was typical . He was odd , starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep . Any Freudians who catch `` '' Saturday Afternoon '' '' will have a field day with the scenes between this timid , pudgy-faced baby-man and his stern , gently domineering mommy-wife . When Harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over , you 'd swear you 're watching an interaction between a 6 year-old boy and his Mama . . . and maybe that 's why Harry Langdon gave some people the creeps , and still does. < br / > < br / > But he 's a compelling screen figure , and it 's not what he does so much as the way he does it . In that scene with the coins under the rug , for instance , Harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other , carefully , like a tightrope walker , counting off his paces until he finds the right spot , and his technique is hypnotic . Langdon moved like no one else . Whether or not he makes you laugh , the guy is mesmerizing , seemingly in a world of his own . Where the plot of his films is concerned Harry is curiously passive , and almost never drives the story forward himself . In the finale of `` '' Saturday Afternoon , '' '' when the big fistfight is taking place , Harry 's co-star Vernon Dent is in the thick of the action , but Harry is in a daze for much of the time , and winds up sort of punch-drunk between two cars ( sitting on the running board of one , but with his feet on the other ) while they race through the streets . It 's a memorable image , and , as the critic Walter Kerr wrote , it encapsulates Langdon 's screen persona quite perfectly : he 's a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action , blinking sleepily while the world rushes past . It 's also worth noting that Langdon and Dent , who worked together frequently , have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint Laurel & Hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later . Langdon 's style was a likely influence on Stan Laurel , especially here. < br / > < br / > '' '' Saturday Afternnon '' '' and its star may not be for everyone , but the film is well worth a look , and you might find that Langdon makes an impression that 's hard to shake .

The acting is your typical , unsubtle , idiotic , standard sitcom flailing-limbs type acting . And why oh why did this crap replace arrested development ? Well you got ta hand it to Fox . They know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers . You see , the reason Arrested Development was n't massively popular was because it was so smart . It was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb . And of course , if a dumb person encounters a smart person , the dumb person will hate the smart person . Most of the time anyway . Either that , or try and mooch off of the smart person . If you like this show , and are one of the dumb people , I truly can not fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds . I can not fathom what it must be like to be mindless , laughing drones , influenced by every little thing . Basically , people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots . Trained , obedient , mindless parrots . Maybe I should n't insult parrots by comparing them to you . You know who you are . ( If I seem like a bastar* in this review , it 's because I 'm so annoyed at AD being canceled . )",0,negative
21091,"The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick . Sadly it 's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements . It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood , but that 's the only blood in the entire film. < br / > < br / > The Evil Below is n't the worst around , but for a horror film it is tediously boring . The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads . There 's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director did n't know what to do . I manged to sit through it all ( just about ) but I would n't recommend this film to ANYONE . Horror fans might want a copy for the cool VHS cover , but it 's best left at that .",0,negative
5090,"`` Wow , I think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low . There 's really no reason to dislike this film . `` `` Michael '' '' is a simple , but fairly original , and easily enjoyable romantic comedy . The plot involves a group of reporters/experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel ( John Travolta ) in the midwest . The angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect , and that 's what makes it entertaining . His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing . The romantic side of this film involves Michael the angel trying to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together . The two of them may not have the all-time greatest on-screen chemistry , but they certainly have enough to make it work well . Everyone who has rated this film so low ( a 5.4 ? ? ) , come on ! The film is not that bad . In fact , I found it quite funny and memorable . Sure , it 's not the best thing you 'll ever see , but it 's still good . This is a film I feel has been remarkably underrated . It 's fun , romantic , and recommended by me. < br / > < br / > *** out of **** ''",1,positive

3706,"This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning . On top of that , it is a wonderful learning experience . I 'm not one for educational documentaries , but this one grabs hold of you and does n't let go until the end . You 'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you 'll forget your at home watching TV ! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up ! With all the evil and death in this world , this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving .",1,positive
9684,"As I type these comments I 'm watching a DVD of this movie that I just got from a mail-order dealer , and I 'm finding that it holds up extremely well , with strong characterizations , believable situations , and well-staged action scenes. < br / > < br / > It 's been a good 45 years , maybe 50 , since I saw HELL BELOW , but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway 's death scene , which several other commenters have mentioned here . I have n't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing , but I can vouch for what other comments have said : once you see Sterling Holloway 's death scene in this movie , you will absolutely never , ever forget it . Judging from how strong the film so far is holding up , I fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it -- as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history . The movie 's worth seeing for that moment alone , but even without it , it would be a first-rate early submarine drama .",1,positive
2388,"I 'm a big fan of Naruto , even though I have n't watched every episode or read every manga. < br / > < br / > I really liked the first Naruto movie , and to tell you the truth I was a little nervous that this one would n't be as good ( or action packed ) as the first ( mainly because this one in Australia only had a PG instead of an M , which is a PG-13 US or 12 UK ) . But I was wrong ( thankfully ) ! The animation was more improved ( although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed ) and was very good especially in the fight scenes. < br / > < br / > Speaking of that , let 's talk about the fight scenes ! The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining ! I especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors ! All the characters you want are here ! Naruto , Sakura , Gaara , Kankuro and Shikamaru ! If only Temari was in the movie , Shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion ! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS ! In my summary at the top I say that this qualify 's more as a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode . And it does ! The action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting ! Overall , this is a excellent anime Film that is a must-see for any Naruto fan ! 5/5 ! 10/10 ! 50/50 ! 100/100 ! Alright I 'll stop !",1,positive
13197,"`` From the weeks and weeks of promotion for this , ABC 's `` '' The One '' '' was supposed to be `` '' The Real World '' '' meets `` '' American Idol . '' '' We were to watch these singers perform , compete and see how they lived together in a house as well . The Drama ! The Tension ! < br / > < br / > Where does one begin with this atrocity ? Let 's start with the `` '' judges '' '' who were known as `` '' Music Experts '' '' on this program . `` `` Experts '' '' implies they have expertise . Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree . He was in charge of Motown Records for a time . The other two ... eh . Kate Hudson 's uncle , who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard . He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors . I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light ! And The Paula Abdul wannabe , who did something I did n't think could happen : she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula ! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode . The farce of `` '' critiques '' '' that these three offered was a true joke and an insult , not only to the process of finding the best singer , but to the audience that is now quite savvy , already having done this numerous times on Fox. < br / > < br / > There was the host . George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest . In fact , he was as lackluster as can be . He actually sucked what little energy there was in the program , dry . How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show. < br / > < br / > The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program ? This was literally a talent-free talent show . OK. Perhaps that 's an exaggeration . And granted , the performers all have to be relatively close in ability , because if they were not , there would n't be a `` '' contest . '' '' If only one person was `` '' good , '' '' there would be no `` '' suspense . '' '' So , I get that they all needed to be comparable . But they all should have had *some* chops ! Additionally , the judges were running a `` '' Singing Academy , '' '' so the program was part `` '' Fame , '' '' as well . Clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons . But you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented . And that definitely was n't what was happening here. < br / > < br / > It seemed in casting the show , the priority was on the `` '' homelife '' '' elements , as all of the players were very attractive to look at , in equal parts to how badly they vocalized . But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced , you could n't get into the stories that were starting to happen , so the show did n't capture the events there , either. < br / > < br / > As badly devised as all of that was , `` '' The One '' '' had an incredible , unbelievable , fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable. < br / > < br / > The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best , just like on `` '' AI . '' '' But then , after the audience vote was revealed , the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song . The `` '' music experts , '' '' based on that performance , chose one person from the three to save for the following week . And THEN , the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two , sending the remaining contestant home. < br / > < br / > The `` '' design flaw '' '' was that the contestants had the final say . I mean , if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could , would you vote to KEEP the better singer , or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival ? Any first season viewer of CBS 's `` '' Survivor '' '' could answer that one ! And that 's exactly what happened on the program . The person who had the better potential was lost , and the contestants voted back `` '' the one '' '' who had no talent at all ! On top of that , the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the `` '' experts '' '' was also allowed to vote against the remaining two ! It was a complete farce ! < br / > < br / > Maybe if they let the contestants vote first , at least the `` '' experts '' '' would save the better of two evils to finish . But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast , how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it . ''",0,negative

5742,"I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since . This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines . Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under.From what I can tell , this is historically accurate , and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism . I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the Phillipines by 1945 , so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened . I might not have been able to identify with the film 's characters , but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive . If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films , this film would be on it . See it if you can get it .",1,positive
2516,"`` Death Camp Opera : Right Here , Right Now ! < br / > < br / > Ten years ago , I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society . A certain Peter Watkins was the author . His picture was acted by some non-professional actors , citizens like you and me and others . The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic . Was it a movie , a documentary ? Both actually. < br / > < br / > Over the years , I realized how hard it was to find it . Maybe I would , by coincidence ? Anyway , it 's yet an old story . I saw it a short while ago . Totally impressing . My very favourite peace of art : Punishment Park is its name . I love this `` '' docu-fiction '' '' , this `` '' truecastmovie '' '' , this `` '' realityshowfictionnal '' '' , what ever . After all the shock movies I saw , I reach the best with this strong and intense cinematography'experience . I found a masterpiece . There is enough on the net to know many things about the movie . It is even to buy on DVD , with additional stuff . The only words I want to add is about my own experience with this film . I can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people , those who direct , act or watch . A cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art adventure or the opposite . < br / > < br / > So , I 'm not talking about all the 'mucs ' we can see on TV , especially the 'real'shity-show ' whom the concepts of people playing them-selves are interesting , but used in a stupid and perverse way . In Punishment Park , we can see some real individuals living as they are . We only put them in a very specific context , with a few lines to follow , and we let them be what they want to be . It 's a kind of therapy , a way of 'individuation ' for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens . Then , to end , the director 's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie , a desperate scream , a 'Death Camp Opera ' , where some folks are on the run after virulent trials . Punishment Park is for those who want to grow . See this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality . Grow up and harmonize yourself with it ! If you can feel it ! If you can see it ! ! In my case , Punishment Park is stuck in me for ever , with all my love , consciousness and will . ''",1,positive
9774,"I started watching this one very tensed because I heard so many different things about it . Somewhere I read it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG-13 for violence . Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids ( and I thought it was also for kids to watch ) . Well , now I 've seen it so many times and still do n't know in which category to put it . It is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment . Because of the nice relationship and the adventures I would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters I know but I fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children . Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film I must say this nevertheless : Watch it , especially the kids ! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the scriptwriter for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after having fled from The King ( who did n't even return to terrorize the remained Mary and Mikey ) . It is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy - and I did n't expect it to - but this solution left me very , very sad !",1,positive
4068,"`` It is not surprising that this film was made by I 'm Kwon Taek at the time it was . He examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang , and these comprised his last two films . What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon , his 2002 offering , is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films. < br / > < br / > Nonetheless , the experienced hand of I 'm comes through . We explore together the life of a real person : a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who , because of that , causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike . The painter , Chang Seung Up , known popularly as Oh Won ( performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik , the famous star of Park Chan Wook 's already legendary `` '' OldBoy '' '' ) becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film . Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact , or maybe because of the fact , that he was so ostracized in his time . I'm 's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact . I 'm is a master at capturing his country 's past idiosyncrasies , and in this film he almost outdoes himself . As expected in an I 'm film , the cinematography is breathtaking , the editing is precise and the story is central. < br / > < br / > Plots are set against Seung Up , family ties are tested and broken , scandalous behavior is alleged ( and is sometimes real ) , all to bring down the man who `` '' painted fire . '' '' But against all the intricacies of I'm 's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up 's life , Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive . He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look . Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off `` '' Oh Won . '' '' In other words , lines of people , who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up , an artistic star , begin to form . But he refuses to be manipulated . His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience , if not the cast . < br / > < br / > What does Seung Up think ? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting , such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished . He despises those who would try to turn art into profit . And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous . But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals . Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented . I'm 's signature historical epic motif , and his influence in the realm , remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic . < br / > < br / > The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint . This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning , one that is not just political , but social in nature . I 'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion . < br / > < br / > He , Oh Won , becomes a Jesus figure . The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support , but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be . Eventually , both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible . His holiness becomes human ; his humanity is not accepted ; he dies for ( or escapes from ) the sins of the commoners , the art critics , the politicians , who hound him . < br / > < br / > But does he die ? As with most of I'm 's films , a question remains . In this case , does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit ? The film does not tackle that question ; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up , or Oh Won . No death is depicted because no death is known . < br / > < br / > It is difficult to find fault with this film , but I 'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does , it hardly surprises anymore . As usual for I'm 's films , the cinematography , the editing and the writing are all first rate . It 's a well-crafted film imbued with I'm 's uncanny story-telling ability . Granted , he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori . Still , the film contains stretches of this admirable art form , and by the end , viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great , untold story . And they have , because that , precisely , is I'm 's gift . ''",1,positive
15582,"`` One Night at McCool 's wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy . It pushes its `` '' quirky '' '' characters and `` '' outrageous '' '' situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime . The premise is about a gold digging woman , named Jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder , so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires . You know , this would n't be a bad strategy , if she chased after rich guys . This film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew `` '' Dice '' '' Clay . Please . That major flaw in Jewel 's scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker ( and that 's unintentional ) . Watching it , it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere . One Night at McCool 's just could not decide what direction it wanted to take , so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo . It tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera , and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian . There is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist ( played by Matt Dillon ) about how the sex is with Jewel . It seems like Matt does n't know , neither do the viewers . Why was he dating her anyway ? One Night at Mccool 's also wants to be funny . Sorry , bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings did n't even work on Three 's Company . What 's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy . Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety , nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks . What the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way . ''",0,negative

Arnold has done so many better performances in the past few years . I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero were gone from our lives . Sadly this film panders to the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a bellowing , grunting , face contorting muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up . In a cliche last moment ( and at one other time ) , that was predictable from the start , we see a glimmer of the actor that has proven he is more than what he got paid for early in his career .
