"I got a facial and they did not have sheets on the table . Literally there was only a blanket and a table pad . I did n't pay much attention to this until after my service when I saw the same blanket being used for a person after me . The man at the counter who is apparently Ashley 's husband was rude and was having a loud conversation about sports with another man in the spa . It is a spa setting and I just felt that it was unprofessional when I came there to relax and have a pampering day . Additionally , he quoted me the wrong price for the mani/pedi and only told me after the service when I was paying that he was mistaken about the price . I heard Ashley is great , but I had another aesthetician and she was also great for the facial . Place was clean , but I 'm giving them only 3 stars because I got a mani/ pedi and they had very limited colors . It was uncomfortable not to have a foot stool in the room they use for the mani/pedi . Man/ husband was unprofessional and it really was distasteful .",2,neutral
"They were accommodating as I wanted the special baked pasta but without the meat . It was tasty , though one mushroom barely constitutes listing it as an ingredient . The meal delivery was slow in comparison to the limited number of customers . I found the prices a little steep for the quantity/quality received . I would not recommend unless you are staying in the hotel and get a discount or points .",1,negative
"Went to this place with my kids cause we thought it looked cool , tried it . It was horrible . Tacos look like dog meat or some sorta dog food , not carne asada , and the chicken in my torta was some sort of canned chicken , almost mistaked it for tuna cause of the almost similar smell and texture . I 'm really big at eating/shopping at small and local business and restaurants cause that 's where you always get the good stuff , but got ta tell yeah I was really disappointed when I came to this place . 16 bucks for 3 tacos that went in the trash and a torta along with a mediocre hot dog and drinks . Never coming back here again . My fingers still smell like the meat in the torta .",0,very negative
"The d stands for dump . Though this hotel advertises its newly remodeled room this place is still old and falling apart . The remodel consists of a few cosmetic cover-ups , dancing girls showing some skin , and loud music . The bathtub felt like you would fall to the floor below when you stand in the wrong spot and was chipping off all over . The drawer on our dressor would n't closed and was propped up by a piece of paper . Sadly , our room was the upgraded premium corner king . The view was probably the only saving grace . The elevators are supposed to be an upgrade but they are TERRIBLE ! So slow and confusing for many . Overall , a dump with a fancy paint job",0,very negative
"Damn good food , happy with the meal . I have been here twice . The steak and the tea so GOOD !",3,positive
"Good for a few hours of fun away from the strip . Nice exhibits . Not too technical for me but not too 'dumbed-down ' for hubby , who has a PhD in physics . Besides , where else can you have your picture taken next to Robby the Robot ?",4,very positive
"This is a poor apolgy for an ISP . They first wanted my SS number to run credit . When I told them that I would rather give them a deposit than have them run credit , they first refused . Then after lots of back and forth , they charged my Amex for $ 100 for equipment deposit and set up an install date . This morning someone calls me and said they need the SS number after all and since I didnt provide it , they have arbitarirly cancelled my appointment and needed me to reschedule . I offered to show them my ATT & T , Verizon and Dish bills to show that I have been a customer and never been late , but this woman did not want to hear it . Kept insiting that I fax them a copy of my SS card . Can these people be really that retarded ? I asked for a copy of the receipt to show the $ 100 charge to my Amex . The operator and a supervisor said it could not be done . \n\nI finally told them to cancel the order and refund my money . Surprise , surprise , they wanted my money immediately but it takes them 10-12 days to refund my money via a paper check . \n\nDont know anything about how good or bad their service is , but if their customer service is any indiaction , I have no intention of finding out . I am running the other way , Gangnam style .",0,very negative
Food is great ! Fast and friendly service . Get the meatballs and arugula salad . So good !,4,very positive
"`` Came for lunch after Hot Pilates . We were impressed with the authentic French food . Portion sizes were fair , nice mild flavors indicative of French food . Mama likes ! ! ! Please check all the other positive reviews before caving in on the \ '' '' '' '' 2\ '' '' '' '' negatives ( which seem like one hater and one friend of the competition ) Honestly , you give 1 star if food sucks , service sucks , the place was trashy and so forth . Give this place a try , most of us LOVE it . And I am sure real Yelpers would never try to ruin business for a company because we did n't have our butts kissed then massaged while being comped a meal ! The real Yelpers have spoken , and it appears Baguette Cafe IS a winner . Oliver , can I get a free torte for this review ? ; - ) ''",4,very positive
"Ottawa University was a welcomed breath of fresh air after attending University of Phoenix . 98 % of the facilitators were involved , caring and really knew the subject they were in charge of . I truly see and feel the value of my degree .",3,positive
"I got their green chile which was good except the rice had uncooked grains here and there , so you 'd chow down on the rice that was mostly soft and all of a sudden your teeth would hit something hard . I pulled it out of my mouth and it ended up being an uncooked grain of rice ! It was almost insidious . We also ordered a burrito that was not included in the bag that we did not discover until we got home , very disappointing experience .",1,negative
"I finally stopped in True Food Kitchen for a quick bite to eat with 2 kids . I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole ( I love spaghetti squash ) and the kids ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and ravioli . I really liked my spaghetti squash - just right portion size and very tasty . The kids teriyaki bowl with quinoa was excellent ! ! The ravioli was a bit small portion-wise , and was n't as appealing as the teriyaki , but still good.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly - which we appreciated since we were on a tight schedule . We were here at 4pm though , so there was hardly anyone in the restaurant . Nice atmosphere , and the patio was lovely ( although we did n't sit out there because it was August ) . The bill was $ 30 , which seems a bit steep considering I did n't have anything but water . I guess that 's what you pay in Scottsdale Quarter for fresh , organic food though . Still , it just seems a bit overpriced .",3,positive
"Great Burgers ! Really fun place to stop by for a burger . Everything is fresh , well prepared and a lot of options for toppings and prep . The double burger is ridiculous ! A little pricey compared to In-N-Out right next door .",3,positive
"Lunch buffet , $ 12.95 ( no drink ) . Water refills were frequent , but other than that service was terrible . We came in , waited . Finally , a man approached . He did not speak a word . He showed us to a table , and walked away . after waiting a few minutes we decided no one was coming back and headed for the buffet . The restaurant itself is in need of a scrub down and a spruce up . \n\nThe buffet itself was mostly mediocre . Several items I tried were pretty bad . The fried items were soggy . Most dishes were tasteless , and there was not much selection for a vegetarian.\n\nBUT there was one dish that was out of this world good . Mater Paneer , or green peas and paneer . I am almost crying thinking about it ( NO JOKE ) . It was awesome . One of the best things I 've ever eaten . I could eat this dish for EVERY MEAL EVERY DAY fFOR THE REST OF MY LIFE . Yeah , it needed all caps it was that good . Had it not been for this dish , which was a 5 , I would have given this place only 1 star .",2,neutral
"`` Food was delicious ! If you are unsure what \ '' '' '' '' authentic\ '' '' '' '' Mexican food is , double check with your server about he plate you are interested in before ordering . Great outdoor patio . Slow service . Great house margarita ! ''",2,neutral
Why on gods green earth does this thing exist if it does not run during the time when you get out of the club ... the times you need it way way wat more than your car ! Defeats the entire purpose of buying a 24 hour day pass for 12 flippin dollars ! ridiculous,0,very negative
"It 's my first time and probably the last time I 'll go there . Bouncers are n't the nicest people.. crowd 's okay.. decor is okay.. for some reason , I do n't like how it was setup ... it 's like a maze . A fire hazard like Cathy K mentioned.\n\nMusic ? Neh ... ..",1,negative
"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning . The brunch is a buffet , so bring your appetite . There are different stations for custom eggs/omelets , meats , soup , desserts , seafood , cheese , fruits , etc . Unfortunately the buffet area is in a small area , so it gets pretty cramped when you are getting your food . Waiting in line for food is something that makes me quite uncomfortable and medieval.\n\nThe tapas menu is probably the best thing about the brunch , as they will bring you small dishes of breakfast and seafood options.\n\nIn terms of quality , the prepared food , like the tapas and omelet station are quite good . Aside from that , the mass prepared food is pretty average . The breads and dessert are below average , since they are both dry and flavorless . I think I would have been satisfied if the whole meal for two was less than $ 30 , but sadly it was about double the price.\n\nFor the value , I do not think I would return for the brunch .",2,neutral
Food was great but server got order wrong maybe because music is to loud . They play a good mix of music that we like . Over all we would come back here .,2,neutral
Met these guys at a Yelp party . The crab cake slider was wonderful . Tons of flavor . Also had a steak slider that was very good but the crab cake stole the show ! The owners were very friendly . I 'll be looking for these guys next time I 'm in Charlotte ! ! !,4,very positive
This place normally has great food but I ordered the Chicken breast pita melt and it was disgusting . After I took one bite of it I felt like throwing up . I will order other items from them but never a Chicken pita Melt again .,1,negative
"Now I know the idea here is to be a southern style smokehouse . But I hate to be the one to break the bad news to the nice people of Bofingers , but there 's more to it than putting meat in a smoker and waiting . \n\nI 've been to this restaurant two times , and both times I left disappointed . The idea is good , but they did n't succeed in creating something memorable .",1,negative
Great atmosphere and good value pricing ! Our new favorite on the East side of Madison . Decent wine selection at below average inflated pricing . You should try it !,4,very positive
"EPIC FAIL ! \n\nWow , what a complete disappointment ! HORRIBLE service ! \n\nWe ( 2 of us ) went in a little after noon on a Sunday for lunch . It was my first time trying a Wing Stop and I was super disappointed . The store hours say they open at 11am , but when we walked in after noon they were still setting things up and took several minutes to come to the counter to greet us . They were nice enough , but it took over 20 minutes to get our food.\n\nOver 20 minutes for hot wings is ridiculous . Then to add insult to injury one of the two orders of fries was so over salted it was inedible . They replaced the fries without any hassle , but all the fries were not cooked the same . They were cut all oddball with some skinny and some thick , so some were overcooked and some undercooked.\n\nThe wings were decent , but nothing impressive . I have had better at several other wing places . There are too many places that make good wings and have good service to ever go here again.\n\nI have a hunch the reason for the bad service was no management . I did n't see any manager in the store . Everyone looked college age and while it is certainly possible a college age person could be a manager , nobody in that store acted like one . \n\nSteer clear if you want good food with good service .",0,very negative
