"I wish I could give this a 3.5 ! It 's a wonderful place for a quick lunch - but this is not a place I would frequent for dinner due to atmosphere and menu choices , hence the lower rating . If you 're a fan of the walk up and order establishments , this would be a prime contender . Now for the food ! I 'm not a huge fan of their pizzas . They taste great with gourmet ingredients - thin crust , but there are so many other pizza joints I would suggest first . What I do love and highly suggest are their salads . I think my favorite would have to be the caprese , which is actually a standard salad with lettuce , pieces of tomato and fresh mozzarella mixed in , an amazing balsamic vinaigrette , and to top it off ... lightly crunchy buttered/oiled croutons made from their fresh bread . \n\nMy second choice salad is the chicken/gorgonzola/tomato/pine nut one . Fresh light dressing makes this a summer time delight . \n\nTheir bruschetta is also great , but expect them to be small in portion , very individual , not shareable as an appetizer really . Great flavors ! \n\nPaninis and pasta also are a large portion of the menu , but alas , I have not tried any of these yet ! \n\nIn all , a great place to grab a quick bite with good food aimed to please . If you 're familiar with restaurants like Noodles n Co or Cosi , this is right in line . Not quite what I expected from a FOX creation , but yummy.\n\np.s . their triple chocolate cookies ( plain cookie dough , dark , milk , white chips ) are way worth $ 1 more . Make sure to take advantage of them because I am addicted even though I do n't really love chocolate !",3,positive
My sister first discover this place because she loves Japanese food . When I use to work in the Ballantyne area we would go here at least once or even twice a week for lunch . \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and you get your money 's worth of food . The lady that owns the restaurant is also extremely friendly and service is always fast . \n\nDefinately worth a try if you love Japanese food and sweet carrots !,3,positive
"They told us last call in 5 minutes . We ordered . I think the cooks took it out on us . Everything was suuuuuper salty . Like exaggerated salt . Not sure if it was msg too . I am still thirsty . Just a bad experience not sure if it was bad timing but never going there again . Ordered the tiger roll , it was good , nothing special . Spicy crab roll . Salty . Meatball app , salty . Yellow tail collar , salty . We told the waitress and she brushed us off . Everyone just wanted to go home , I guess . Not worth it .",0,very negative
"I 've been here twice . It seems both times , they had the same items in the buffet . Service was poor - none of the wait staff say anything to you until you pay the bill . We were seated by the window and a neon sign that was making a loud noise and smelled like it was burning or going to catch fire . The food was ok - the samosas were subpar , Maharaja on the West side seems to have the best tasting food and the most options for vegans/vegetarians .",1,negative
"In a single word , Awesomeness ... . For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants , there 's really nothing that can compare to Mastros . There 's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club . \n\nMy last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week . That did n't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations . When you walk into Ocean Club , there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale . \n\nI was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple . We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room . The service was impeccable . We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server . We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends . \n\nMy friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this . Dare I say , we 're pretty predictable ... . for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100 % orders bone-in filet . We were in luck , they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should . Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.\n\nSo , the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative . I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes , so very yummy and succulent and filling . Not something I would order , but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table ! The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty . My friend loves the creamed corn . My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach . \n\nFor dessert , my friend loves Mastro 's butter cake and we never go there without having it . Again , very tasty and delicious.\n\nThis is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent 's wedding anniversary , a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with . This place is fantastic . It is truly as good as it gets . I 'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro 's Steakhouse . I 'm totally biased , this is the best restaurant chain on the planet . Period .",4,very positive
"I love kitchen stores , and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh . Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware . None of them are really any good for any of us . I wo n't get into what the dangers of them are , but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware , Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8 , 10 , and 12 inch pans . Like non stick , no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca . If you love stainless steel cookware , they have anything you want from All Clad , made right in Canonsburg Pa . There 's Fiesta ware from Wheeling , and If you want Emeral 's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well , they have a full service kitchen in back . Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space , but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they 've prepped . \n\nIt 's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices . But well worth it !",3,positive
"`` I have never written a review before , but after a restaurant experience like this one , I felt as though it was necessary . Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait . Honestly , we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place . Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant . We were seated right away , but did n't receive our actual meals until an hour later . We received our appetizers fairly quickly , but 30 minutes went by after that and we had n't heard anything about where our food was . Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone 's plate but ours . Our server then told us that they were backed up . It was n't that busy in there at the time , and it sure did n't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners . We even saw people sit down after us , finish their meals , and leave ! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long , and he said they were just busy . We waited , and waited . The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place , so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it 's been 40 minutes since our appetizers . He preceded to argue with us and say \ '' '' '' '' I know when I sat you , and I sat you 20 minutes ago ! \ '' '' '' '' I 've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us . How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I 'll never know.\n\n The management was just terrible . That is $ 15 I 'll never spend on a meal there again . We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks . Hopefully they 'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists . Oh , and their bread was extremely hard and cold . Awful experience . ''",0,very negative
"`` DO NOT GO . I had the worst experience ever ! ! ! ! ! Sushi was terrible . It was so dry and did not have any flavor at all . We told the waitress we were not going to eat the food because it looked and tasted bad . The sushi chef comes out , finds out about the situation and goes \ '' '' '' '' What the fuck ! ! ! ! ! .\ '' '' '' '' He kept asking us why we could n't eat the sushi and did not take \ '' '' '' '' Because it tastes terrible\ '' '' '' '' as an answer . After we were done paying , the same chef followed us all the way to the door and started yelling in his own language and started throwing salt all around us . I know in some Asian countries they use salt for purification purpose , and therefore by throwing the salt around us he was treating us as \ '' '' '' '' bad luck.\ '' '' '' '' I would be surprised if he still works there because no one would want to hire such a rude crazy chef like him .

"Crowded , mashups , girls all wearing the same clothes , horrible booze ( like poison-you horrible ) , $ 12 drinks , $ 450 bottles . Not my scene but the club was pretty/well appointed . Many floors . Might be someone else 's idea of a fun night , but it definitely was n't mine .",1,negative
Second time i ordered Chicago style pizza thought i would give them a fair chance.\nI lived in Cicago for 35 years i love Chicago pizza THEIRS IS NO CHICAGO PIZZA.\nI do n't know about the rest of the menu but you will be disappointed if you know pizza and expect a real Chicago experience . The dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough . \nSo stay away from ordering Chicago Style unless you have money to waste,1,negative
"I just called to place a very last minute order and spoke with Michelle , one of the owners and I can not express my thanks and gratitude enough for the most excellent customer service I received . I know that the 50th Anniversary shirts ordered will be amazing and that I will never use another printing company based on what I just experienced . Thank you so very much to Michelle ! ! !",4,very positive
Very convenient to Uptown festivities ! Located right in the EpiCentre on College this hotel and fun lounge is a great place to stay while in Charlotte . The rooms are trendy and cool - sporting bright colors and nice finishes . The lounge area is really casual and fun . It overlooks the top of the EpiCentre AA5 outdoor patio . Full bar and wine selections available at the lounge . Not as classy as the other hotels nearby but definitely worth a shot !,2,neutral
Fairly average as far as little mom & pop Chinese joints go . The best one in the area though ( There 's only 2 ) \n\nReally have n't had a chance to explore more than just a few staple dishes yet though . What I have tried was fairly good though.\n\nThe place was clean and the service was fast helping give them a rock solid 3 stars .,2,neutral
"We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from Raymond Vineyards designed especially for Morton 's called primal cut and it was boldly delicious and perfect for the steaks we ordered.\n\nSuperb aged four weeks steaks ! My husband had the porterhouse and I had the NY strip both perfectly prepared medium rare ! We ordered a side of mushrooms in au jus and they accompanied the steaks nicely.\n\nBefore the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top . We also shared the Morton 's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies . All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared ! \n\nMy husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks . It was divinely chocalatey ! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal . I had tastes and sips of both and they were delicious , and was too full to have my own ! \n\nWe enjoyed sitting together in the circular booth and talking and sharing a superb meal \nmade all the more pleasant with a wonderful waiter and maitre d ' .",4,very positive

"`` I went to My Mother 's for dinner with a large group of family members ( 16 ) , including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old . While the decor was generically bad \ '' '' '' '' down-home\ '' '' '' '' from the 80 's , the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.\n\nThe meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft . This gave me hope that the meal would n't be in keeping with the general feel of the place . Alas , my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.\n\nAfter ordering , I made my way to the salad bar . This seemed quaint , considering that salad bars are n't really popular anymore , unless you 're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes . The salad bar was not entirely scary , but was n't anything worth going back to . I 'm fairly certain everything came out of a can , bag , bottle or box . The freshest thing may have been the red onion , which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.\n\nMoving on to the main course , I had Mother 's Meat Loaf dinner . My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans . Once again , food from cans and boxes made an appearance , as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix . The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat , but was n't all that exciting . It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top , yet was served with gravy on the side ( probably originally made from a powder mix ) . I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry , not because of the quality.\n\nHoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state , I ordered pie for dessert . They tout their homemade pies , but seem to think that \ '' '' '' '' homemade\ '' '' '' '' means making pie from canned ingredients . My cherry pie was not spectacular , as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light , flaky and buttery , but only managed to be dry and chewy.\n\nMy Mother 's was saved from a one-star rating by two things ... the graciousness and patience of the staff , and the low prices . For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I , our total bill including tax and tip was $ 35.\n\nMy advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother 's Restaurant .

"One of the best places for dinner on the strip ! My friends and I ate dinner on the Patio . The view of the strip as well as the Bellagio 's Fountains in the background was great . As for price , it ran us about $ 350.00 for 5 people to have a full 3 course dinner with wine . We had not seen each other so we spent well over two hours talking and socializing during our dinner . This was one of the best evenings we all spent together in Las Vegas . It is a lot of food , but take your time and have the soup , main course , and desert . Desert is hard to order when your full , but it is absolutely amazing here ! \n\nThe wait staff did a great job taking care of us . We were never once interrupted and even with a busy place they took their time with us explaining everything as well as giving us the felling there was no hurry take your time . The most amazing thing , was that we thought our waitress did such a good job we tipped her very well . She came running after us to make sure that we understood that we had given a large trip . After we explained that yes we did that intentionally she thanked us and wished us a good night .",4,very positive
"`` I was very excited to try this place after seeing the reviews on here . We waited for about 30 minutes for our table , which is n't too bad in general , but upon being seated I figured out what the break in the chain is : the kitchen . \n\nOur waiter , Luke , was competent and friendly . As we waited for food , I could n't help but notice large gatherings of servers standing at the food \ '' '' '' '' window\ '' '' '' '' waiting for the seemingly missing dishes from their orders . Plates would appear one at a time , which was odd since the average table size was 4+ . It became obvious that food tickets were n't being completed a ticket at a time , instead , they were batching meals . \n\nOur appetizer , chocolate covered bacon , came out just before our meals started to be delivered ... which took about 20 minutes after ordering . One side of pancakes ( regular ) were delivered . Then , a few minutes later , the second and third side of pancakes ( pumpkin cheesecake ) . Then , yet another few minutes later , the french toast entree arrived . It took almost 10 minutes for the omelets to come out . One side of pancakes never came out , so we got them to go . \n\nThe food was very good ! The kitchen manager was seen speaking very \ '' '' '' '' animated\ '' '' '' '' to the waiters and line cooks , which was unprofessional and , from what I could tell , he was the weak link ( in the white shirt on the left facing away in the picture ) . Ticket times were all over the place , and orders were not being delivered all-at-once . \n\nThe restaurant has been around for 5 weeks , so they should be over growing pains like this . We will be back for the food , though.\n\nFor those complaining about the noise : I feel you . No carpet , no cushions , all hard surfaces ! \n\nThey take reservations , which is good ! ''",2,neutral
