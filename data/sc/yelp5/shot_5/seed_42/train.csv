"Great pub ! So why only two stars ? Utterly horrible management . Do n't even consider entering the doors unless you are a middle class conventional clone , as they will ask you to leave unless you are dressed correctly in their eyes , speaking in the right accent , and behaving 'correctly ' . Oh , and do n't you dare fail to fill in their obscure food-ordering slips absolutely correctly , or prepare to be soundly scolded by the ridiculously snobbish staff . Pity , the place itself is worth a look , despite the seriously excessive prices . But the people who run it make it a 'never go back ' experience unless you love to be humiliated by snobs .",1,negative

"The medium golden wings are flawless EVERY time we order them . The Focaccias ( sp ? ) are delicious , although the ingredients do n't seem to be consistent . Beer is good . I love beer , and they serve lots of it in BIG mugs . Mmmm beer . Good . The taco salad is always good too . My son loves all the food here ... whatever hits the table he eats . I love that we can substitute fries & rings with a salad , and the kid meals have a choice for carrot sticks as a side- LOVE that . The only thing that bothers me is being charged for salad dressing . One side comes with your order , but you have to pay for extra ... if 3 people are sharing wings that becomes annoying .",3,positive
"Good food at an amazing price . That being said , they seem to be working out the kinks of a new restaurant , which makes it hard to give it a fourth star . The drinks and appetizers were excellent , but my entree was a real struggle to get through . It was a parsnip cream sauce over excellent fresh pasta , but the parsnip sauce was very bitter and bland . Salt was requested to take the edge off , which apparently is frowned upon since it took maybe 10 minutes for the waiter to bring me a shot glass with a few salt crystals . Food snobbery like this is n't that offensive to me , but when the restaurant does n't yet have quality control in place to ensure they are n't serving old parsnips , which I am guessing is what happened to those of us unfortunate enough to order the pasta that night , it is really disappointing . All this aside , the space is great , and the quality of the rest of the dishes was enough to make me want to try again .",2,neutral
"`` Why oh why did it take me so long to discover Padre 's ? \nBeing a huge fan of modern Mexican cuisine , I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food served at Padre 's . I found them to be in the same family as Dick 's or Sierra Bonita , muy bueno ! \n\nThe outside of the building is a bit deceiving and the parking is pretty tight . I was n't quite prepared for what we stepped in to . Came on a Friday night and chose to sit in the dining area ( my date tried to opt for the huge patio , but it was far to windy for that ) . The band Cascabel was playing in the bar area , and the music and volume were the perfect enrichment to our dining pleasure . \n\nWe started with the jalapeno-bacon wrapped scallops and they were to die for . The bacon was cooked in jalapenos wich gave it just the right bite at the end . The scallops surrounded a pesto risotto and sat in a roasted red pepper cream sauce . The pesto risotto was not only delicious , but a delightful surprise at a \ '' '' '' '' Mexican Restaurant\ '' '' '' '' . \nFor our meal we shared the modern cowboy steak , a 12oz . grilled rib eye , guajillo mashed potatoes , sauteed garlic spinach and again with the delicious roasted red pepper cream . I really loved the mashed potatoes , they were red from all the chili seasoning and absolutely perfect . \n\nI washed all this down with a sangria and although it was a bit tart ( tasted like they used a sweet and sour mixer ) it was still decent . \nThe multiple rooms in the restaurant keep it intimate , while the bar area provides a more lively atmosphere . The service was excellent , I ca n't wait to return for HH ! ''",3,positive
"I ordered 2 dishes.\n\nGreen Curry Chicken - tasted okay , quality of food was good . overall good , but i did n't like how expensive it was . maybe its because there are n't many thai restaurants that they can charge a lot , but i 've had much better elsewhere for much cheaper.\n\nBasil Beef - I 've never had basil beef that was served with ground beef ! I usually get pieces/slices of beef , but this place served it with ground beef . after i realized it was ground beef , i had only a little bit since it did n't taste all that good.\n\nadvice : do n't order beef dishes , go with the chicken .",1,negative
"I have been here several times and each time it has been a great experience . I am sort of a makeup junkie , especially Bare Escentuals ( I 've pretty much been a loyalist since I was a teenager ) and everyone here is so knowledgeable about the products . Returns/exchanges have always been easy as well . I also appreciate how they do n't work on commission , that they just want to give you products that you need/want to spend on . \n\nThe selection and kits here are awesome . A word of warning to anyone thinking about converting : never fall in love with anything from a kit . The colors are often just kit-specific and do n't exist as individual products . ( Love u , citrine radiance . come back to me , pls . ) \n\nIf ever you want to try mineral makeup , BE is where it 's at . Do n't go for the cheap stuff , because it wo n't last and wo n't give you the result that you want -- believe me , I have tried to get out of spending $ 27 per unit of foundation and it just is n't the same ! Try it out -- they take everything back with receipts and have a very generous , flexible return policy !",4,very positive
"The most important thing to me in an airline is that we do not fall out of the sky in an uncontrolled fashion . After all landing is a controlled crash . So far they have done well in this area.\n\nIt seems each flight I have had with this airline the seat is not working as it should . It always leans back and will not set straight . One gets tired of telling the attendant that no I can not bring the seat up to upright position . This last flight seat was quite uncomfortable , my rump was sore soon after we took off . This is the second thing past crashing that I think an airline should consider , comfort of the seating area . Arriving back in Phoenix one goes to pick up the checked bag . one waits and waits and waits some more , two other flights that landed since we arrived have come and gone . A bunch of grumpy tired travelers is not a pretty sight to behold , Luckily they only had to look over at me to see the face of calm and patience ; - { ) We finally got home at 12:01 am after landing at 10:40 p.m.\n\nBut hey we did not crash so they are A-OK with me.\n\nOh and we know airlines do not pamper anymore , well unless we are on an international flight . So we know to take what we need to keep us happy in the air .",2,neutral
"`` I do n't understand how this place has so many stars , it 's definitely not a 4 star establishment . Bottom line - it 's not worth the price . I ordered the fez salad ; it 's basically two handfuls of field greens , three halves of CANNED pears , barely a tablespoon of goat cheese , and a few slivers of almonds . The menu clearly states \ '' '' '' '' cinnamon marinated pears\ '' '' '' '' , such bullshit . Totally false advertising . My husband ordered the bleu cheese burger , the patty had the texture of meatloaf ( gross ) .\n\nThey need to hire real kitchen staff who will prepare what is on the menu . ''",1,negative
"All Ajs are the same , you pretty much know what you are getting into when you walk in . \n\nI have to tell you about this one specifically though . I get lunch here all the time in between shifts from work . AJs is close and they always get my in and out with a quickness . \n\nTheir sandwich 's are supper yummy , the chunky chicken salad or tuna are great choices . They also have a great salad bar . Anything you could want ; roman , mixed greens , ice berg , radishes , three different cheeses , black beans , corn , salami , egg , carrots , cucumber , olives , tomato , croutons , and three or four different dressings . They charge you by wight , so depending on your appetite it 's pretty affordable . \n\nI have never tried their sushi , but they looks great , fresh and a really great variety . Again , the iced tea is awesome . \n\nDue to the kick butt work out and diet I have been committed to lately I have n't been able to frequent the pastry and sweets counter . But you only have to take one look to know it all looks amazing . Tastes amazing too . My favorites are the lemon bars and Napoleons and fruit tarts .

"`` Hello there ! \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My name is Naiby Moreno , and the reason why I 'm writing you this email is because last night , around this time , I was at your location in 4409 E. McKellips Rd , Mesa AZ , 85215 , and I placed an order for a few drinks where my bill came up to a little over $ 20.00 , unfortunately , I lost my receipt so , it 's hard for me to give you the accurate information , however , I asked the cashier who took my order and realized later that it was the Store Mgr , if I could get my drinks in your reusable plastic cups , to what she said , \ '' '' '' '' No problem , \ '' '' '' '' \ '' '' '' '' it will be $ 1.00 each , \ '' '' '' '' so , I said , \ '' '' '' '' Yes , that 's fine\ '' '' '' '' . Since I ordered some frappuccinos , the barista gave me some dome lids and told me , that they were giving me those covers because of the whipped cream , and he also said , but we 'll give you the plastic lids on the side , we are just looking for them , so , I said , perfect ! , my kids and I sat down , and started drinking our drinks , waiting also to get our plastic covers , about 10 minutes had passed by , and I saw the two baristas and the mgr , talking and brewing coffee , but nobody looking for any lids , so I went to the register and ordered an extra item which was a double chocolate chip brownie , so , the same blonde girl who was the \ '' '' '' '' MGR\ '' '' '' '' , took my order again , and I asked her if they had my lids for my cups , because we did need them , so , she gave me a sarcastic look and said , \ '' '' '' '' Oh , I am looking for them\ '' '' '' '' , so , I said , ok , thanks . I went back to my chair and sat down again , and waited , and waited and waited , another 10 to 15 minutes had passed by , so , finally she came out and told us that they did n't have any lids for the cups , but that she was calling some stores to see if they could borrow some from them , so , I said , ok , by this time , I was already getting upset about the fact that she was almost ignoring me , because she did n't even say \ '' '' '' '' SORRY\ '' '' '' '' , and it just seemed that she did n't care , \u00a0 and still I was trying to be nice and asked her if there was any other store around to where she could call and ask to give them to me , if it was on my way home , to what she replied , \ '' '' '' '' I am calling them\ '' '' '' '' , so , again , she went back inside , and again , I waited another 5 minutes , finally she came back again holding one plastic lid and laughing she said , \ '' '' '' '' So , I only have one lid for your cups , but I there is this other store at McDowell and Power , and they have the other lids for you , you just have to go and get them\ '' '' '' '' . Really ? ? ? , is that how you suppose to fix your problems , now , that and her careless attitude pissed me off , so , right after she said that to me I replied with a \ '' '' '' '' and you are the mgr , \ '' '' '' '' and she said yes , and I said , \ '' '' '' '' and you 're sorry ? , because you never said sorry\ '' '' '' '' , so we started arguing when she said \ '' '' '' '' yes I did\ '' '' '' '' , and I said \ '' '' '' '' No you didn't\ '' '' '' '' . After this , I said , in my receipt says that I can get a refund if I do n't want the items , and she said , fine I will give you a refund . I mentioned to her that I was a mgr at a coffee shop as well , and I knew about customer service standards , and I told her that what she was doing was n't the right way of fixing a problem , to what she did n't like , I told her , \ '' '' '' '' you as a Mgr , should know better that if you are out of plastic lids for your cups , you should n't even be selling them , or at least you need to let the customer know about the inconvenience . I asked my kids to finish their drinks because we were returning the cups that I had just purchased for them , because they had no lids for them , thus , we were not going to be able to use them to carry hot coffee , I went back to the register and gave your Mgr the cups that she threw away in the trash can in front of me , splashing milk everywhere around , then she asked me if I was keeping the one cup with the lid , and I said well , yes , my other daughter went home already , so , I ca n't returned that one , so , after going back in the transaction in the system and refunded me for 4 cups , she stated that my total was $ 4.08 then she said , my bad your total is actually less because I gave you \u00a2.10 off each drink , again I said , ok , that was a discount on THE DRINKS not on the cups , and she argued again and said yes , but thats how the system works , so , honestly and at that point I did n't care anymore of what she was doing or saying , I just told her WHATEVER , just give me my money back , I just want to leave this place , so she did , then she made me sign a refund ticket , to proof the transaction , so I signed , and when I was leaving the location , I reminded her , to remove the cups from the display or to at least let her customer know about the inconvenience.\n\u00a0I am sorry , if I made this look like such a big deal , but coming from the management of food industry , I know my rights as a customer and I expect respect and good service , why , because I am paying for my product , I never asked for anything free , just some good service , obviously my question is : What kind of service are your crew members suppose to give , when the Mgr acts that way they wo n't care , right ? , ''",0,very negative
"Pretty disappointed with my last visit . \n\nWent for lunch on a Tuesday with my boyfriend and his daughter around 1:30 , it was pretty dead , only about 4 other seated tables . We were seated quickly , waited for about 10 minutes for a server and no one came . We eventually had to go up to the bar to ask for someone to take out order . The bartender was very apologetic , friendly and took our order quickly . I ordered the BBQ chicken salad , BF got a bacon cheddar burger and the little one got a cheese burger off the kids menu . \n\nSalad was very tasty with good portions and lot of different ingredients for a nice variety of flavor . BFs burger was bland , and they forgot his onion strings . It was a couple dollars extra for the burger meal to be upgraded with sweet potato fries . They were decent , all 15 of them . The kids meal burger was incredible tasteless with a stale bun . She took 3 bites and refused to eat the rest . \n\nAll in all , we will not come back . We were offered a free desert for the lack of service , which was good and a nice gesture , which warrants 2 stars .",1,negative
"As others have said , most of the games here are driving games , and many of them were broken . Some of the games are just plain rip-offs as well , such as their virtual bowling simulator which has messed up sensors ( throw the ball down the center and it detects it as a gutter ? ? ) or their $ 1.50/play Operation game which ended after 15 seconds with no warning.\n\nWith all that said , there are a couple of redeeming things about the place . Some of the arcade games are fun , and you 'll have a lot to try if you like racing games . They also have pool tables , though again , many of them were out of order . Look in the free local discount books for some GameWorks coupons .",1,negative

"Very disappointed ! We were in the area and decided to go to Joe 's and try it out for the first time ( usually we go to Ritas ) . We parked , walked inside , cute decor nice options on the menu but there was a line . No big deal , we stood in line and figured it would move along ... no ... hardly . I do n't know if it was the cashier ( s ) or the customers but after waiting 15 minutes in line and only moved a couple steps we decided the wait was n't worth it . We were n't the only people to decide we were n't going to wait , 2 other couples ended up walking away before us and then shortly after we left . It was obvious there was a line , it was obvious people were leaving because the wait was too long , and not once none of the employees said anything , did n't step up to help with the line , nothing ! ! Joes could have yummy Italian ice , but I would n't know since I could n't order , not in 15 minutes anyways . Who knows when I 'll try it or if I even will .",0,very negative

"The comments about finding the location is true . We circled the block several times . When we called for directions , we were simply given the same address we already had . There was no street level signs to direct you , and with traffic and construction it was a bit of a process.\n\nWhen I checked in , the room was a standard Aloft room . Nothing over the top . However , when I reported my toilet did n't work , I was assured by the front desk ( a young lady who was talking to her co workers ) that it would be fixed . IT WAS NOT . For two days , I did n't have a working toilet nor did they offer to change my room . I was out ( Thank Goodness ) for most of the day/ night but I did end up checking out early because I was so frustrated and grossed out.\n\nThe bar was great and the bar tender was even better . Thank goodness for her and public restrooms.\n\nAloft offered me points to apologize . Via email . No follow up in person , which would have almost been nicer than the points .",0,very negative
"So i can not count how many times i have been to this place ! pretty much once a month . The Real deal is to sit at the bar , so you can fully experience what is Kazu ! or let 's say Who is Kazu ! So last time i was there , i invited one of my friend who never been there before , one of the cook from Satay Brothers ( if you like Kazu you will love them aswell ) . it was his bday . We ordered probably 10 different things , A lot of food we had ! ! And so we could eat More , we decide to take option of eating nothing with rice . We started with the octopus and the Eggplant . \nOctopus was grilled and not overcooked , with perfect spices and a pretty big piece.\nEggplant was something amazing and reminded me of what my dad do . Spanish tapenade . \nWe took the Homemade Tofu , it is nothing special to it , you really got like Tofu and Texture , it was plain Soft Tofu with Soya Sauce . Its was more a Texture experience than anything else . \nTaki Gyoza is one of my favorite appetizer , and Edamane is a Must ! \nBeef Kalbi was perfect cooked , not too much , and was Tender serve with well balance salad . ( actually pretty much everything we had , was serve with a Salad ) \nWe order the grilled Mushrooms , I loved them and again its a texture experience . they had this mix of flavour , i guess because its cooked same grilled as all the meat and fish . I like it , maybe some people wouldnt appreciate it . \nWe order also the Fish Head , it took more time than the other meal , but was one of my fav dishes , we almost order another plate of Octopus but we decided to take the chicken skin and the beef carpaccio . I dont regret it : ) \nand we finish with Sake ice cream . \n\nI didnt drink , my frient had a glass of beer and i took Green Tea , that i really love there . Good Quality of Green Tea . \n\nAnd something you have to know ! Share with everyone the food you order , it is the good way of eating there , and order 1 or 2 plates at a time . Because they are really fast in preparing the meals , and the plates are big , and the tables are small . \n\nFinally the staff is great , i remember the waitress didnt know a word of french , and now they almost fully speak french . Kazu as the most seductive smile . and if you tell him your going come back tomorrow , he will have the cutest laugh ever ! \n\nI would go back only for his charming smile . : ) \n\noh i have mention , the price , for me its cheap , some consider expensive , but for everything we ate , we paid 140 $ all , that includes a 30 $ of tip",4,very positive

I was disappointed that I could n't try any of the others , though .
