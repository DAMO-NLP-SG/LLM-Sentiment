Finally got it right , but hey , the store did n't bat a eye lash when I returned the ones that did n't work , they just asked if I needed help picking out a replacement . \n\nSince my cat has been loosing weight , I could not get the size down , so after my attempts , finally got the small dog size and sure enough it worked . Now to get the cat used to it before we need it . \n\nThis store has everything you could need . They is even a new section by Martha Stewart , everything for you little pet . But her stuffs pricey , a lease from here collection , $ 19.99 , boy that 's steep ! \n\nThe store is clean , neatly kept , well organized and they have grooming services . The employees were friendly and helpful , they looked like they enjoyed their jobs , and I would make this a regular place .",4,very positive
9427,"I chose the 4 Queens for my visit to Las Vegas for several reasons , and I 'll admit a good lot of those involved the low price of the room . ( Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard , the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor . ) \n\nHowever , the quality of my room was far below what I expected , or even dreamed was possible.\n\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms ; generally I only want them to be clean ( not spotless , clean ) and relatively safe . Non-smoking is also on the list.\n\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I 've ever stayed in.\n\nThere was hair ( of the nether-region variety ) in the bathtub . In fact , I do n't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay . I do n't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself , and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\n\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy . I 'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance ( humor me ) to make myself feel better.\n\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived , and spotted quite easily . This was touted to be a non-smoking room . I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff . \n\nNope ; no such luck.\n\nAdditionally , there were cigarette burns in the bedding ( which was made of some , scratchy , ugly cheap fabric ) . Two of the three lamps in the room did not work . At all . The remote did not work . The air conditioner was very , very loud.\n\nI did n't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we 're being held in the city the weekend I stayed , and on the 15th floor , I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly . Granted , I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay , but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\nOh , and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay . I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\n\nLuckily , I take Ambien to sleep , and am dead to the world at night . Even with the Ambien , the world 's rattliest , loudest air conditioner , still woke me up several times each night . This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having . Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\n\nUpdate ! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining . Guess what ? It got worse ! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow ( defying the laws of sound ) louder , and played later into the evening . Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am , they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them . This went on until about 8 am . I pounded on the wall twice , called the front desk , and nothing was done ! I did n't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\n\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am , five hours early for my flight , because the hotel was just that damn bad , and I could n't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\n\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I 've ever stayed in . The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breaking-out .",0,very negative

49498,My mom and I just ate lunch there and I would never go back . We both live in the area and were excited to try it . The service was terrible . It took us forever to get our food and when it did come my pad thai was ok not great and my moms veggie torta was also mediocre . The main reason I will never go back is when we ordered desert our server verbally told us the menu and we ordered the cheesecake . When it came it was covered in peanuts after I specifically told the server I was allergic when I ordered the pad thai peanut free . I 'm leaving on a flight and did n't have time for them to make me something else . So overall mediocre food and terrible service .,0,very negative

I love mexican/southern food so maybe I 'm a slightly harsh critic , but I just was n't really taken with the menu . \nEverything we ordered was a bit too overflowing with cheese and creme fraiche so the vibrant flavours were drowned out .

They have the best tables ! \n\nSadly I had a horrible experience and it has permanently changed my views of this place . I was playing at the Craps table ( $ 3 ) and this very loud group next to me was playing and the man next to me on multiple occasion kept thinking my money was his . So in my mind I am like why are n't these people doing anything to prevent this ? So it got so bad that they actually had to go look at the tape.\n\nSo here is my real issue . The man argued to the staff that it was his money on the table and I was nicely sad that it was mine but the game in no way could be stop while the conflict got resolved . So Money that no one could confirm sat on the table when all I wanted to was grab my money and leave . The Manager on duty Monica was so rude to me she did look at the tape ( for 10-15 mins ) and saw that it was my money and when I asked for my $ 3 back YES $ 3 that they could n't confirm that was mine she tried to tell me I was trying to get over and scamming them . I WAS LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS you guys make $ 3 in 0.02 seconds and you ca n't afford to give me $ 3 ? ? ? ? She told me I had to make an appointment to speak to someone higher than her . the customer service was TERRRRIBLE and it did not stop there.\n\nThe next morning I called and asked to speak to the Operations Manager and he got on the phone and told me he would take a look at it and give me a call back and pretty much said what do you want and we cant give you anything more than $ 3 . I NEVER HEARD FROM THIS MAN EVER AGAIN ! \n\nand I made it clear if you would 've given me the stinking $ 3 I would 've given it right back to you at the craps table . \n\n\nJust be careful at this place ...

These are really good and a different twist on just throwing bread on someone 's table ... plus it is the only thing you can get for free at the Wynn .

I had to ask for more because everyone at my table was dipping all of there food in it.\n\nPersonally the staff is okay here ... I would expect to be more impressed with this being a Wynn Property but it seems like the staff here are lacking in training . I have never seen this place packed in all of the times we have eaten here , so maybe the really good waiters do not want to work here.\n\nMy buddy ordered a calamari starter and it was so fishy I would have thrown it back into the sea . The waiter asked if it was good and he said yes ... but I would have sent it back . If I had ordered that this place would be getting one star.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese Bites Starter was also amazing too . But Mac and Cheese Deep Fried better be good.\n\nI also started with the Lettuce Wedge with Blue Cheese and Bacon . I had no idea that this could be bad . First there is only one strip of bacon that was cooked two days ago sitting on top . Maybe the Chef could have diced this up for me . There was nice chunks of blue cheese but hardly any dressing ... so it was very dry.\n\nSo as you can see I am giving this place 4 stars but that is for those amazing donuts ... everything else is just really good or really bad . I should just commit to the 3 stars but I ca n't do it . I am just not a 3 star guy.\n\nOn Yelp it says that this place is Italian ... there is nothing Italian about this place ... there is one pasta dish but nothing else . In fact , the menu covers ever food choice and is probably more American , then anything else.\n\nThere is also a full bar too , so drink up my friends it is VEGAS !",3,positive
17523,"I went here twice for the time I have been in Las Vegas . The first time , it was pretty good , Service was nice and fast , the food came out at a good pace , everything tasted pretty good . The second however , I was not a fan at all . There was one other table that was seated so I assumed things would come out at a steady time . Boy was I wrong . On my second visit everything was the complete opposite , and I wanted a nice bowl of ramen . Please do not get it here , it is actually the instant ramen stuff , which made me so sad . I feel like i should go in one more time to see how it is , but after the last visit I dont plan to anytime soon .",2,neutral
24712,"I got the stuffed raspberry french toast here , and an omelet , after hearing how great it was , and how cheap . Yeah , there is a reason they do n't have their prices online . It was around 10 dollars for their 'stuffed ' french toast . Let me tell you what stuffed means to them . It means two slices of toast with some kind of cream cheese filling spread in them . And where does the raspberry come from ? The five raspberries they throw on top of it . But I could look past this , I guess , as their way of making stuffed french toast . I surely do n't expect something like Ihop , since this is suppose to be 'home cooked meals ' . But when your stuffing is so miniscule it 's like you spread a small amount of butter on toast , it is very disappointing.\nThen came the omelet with the hash browns . It was n't great . Not bad . But not medium either . The potatoes were ok , then again you should n't be able to mess that up , but the omelet was just ... .eh , I guess is the only reaction I had to it .

725,"I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle , so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.\n\nThe first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends ; if memory serves me correctly , the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins . There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers . This small space is a real life saver when it 's really cold outside.\n\nRegarding the food , I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip ( rare or medium rare ) . Since the prices are so reasonable , you 're basically looking at a $ 10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us , a $ 10 piece of meat is what you 're gon na get . While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip , the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins . They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry . I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy , however it was lacking in the seasoning department , let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce . The loaded baked potato was cooked well , but the cesar salad that I had was very bland . The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.\n\nThe service was great , our waitress was very attentive and friendly . If you asked me if I 'd return , I 'd probably say no . The food quality just is n't what I 'm used to in the realm of steaks . To be honest , I 've had better steaks at some of Charlotte 's local bars . If you 're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $ 20 or less , you ca n't beat the pricing here .",1,negative

48492,"`` BURNED\n\nThis end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices . You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from \ '' '' '' '' The Daily Show\ '' '' '' '' thinks is the best pizza in the world . At the end of the day , real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city . I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza . When I 'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it 's cheap , fast and I 'm hungry . \n\nSo here I am in Las Vegas and not New York . I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street . I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven . It was in the oven for rather a long time . I really was n't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it . \n\nI finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it . The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level . The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I could n't get it off in time . All I could think was why did n't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like , \ '' '' '' '' Hey be careful because it 's really hot ! \ '' '' '' '' I did n't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it . A warning or something would have been a nice gesture . I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry . \n\nI ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth . Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast . I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days . It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas . \n\nI really would n't recommend this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix . Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here . I really wished I would have just walked by this location . The pizza was n't that great just like New York City . If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza , then they nailed it . My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.\n\nOn a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps . It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies . These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here . Enjoy !

I decided to give it another try and what did I get ? ! Another terrible experience . \n\nI came here on this past Thursday night around 830PM . I wish I knew who our server was because I really wanted to complain . My friend and I sat down outside at a table and then a moment later another group sat down after us . Their table received drinks and appetizers before we even got asked what we wanted to order . We honestly waited about 10-15 minutes before I decided to hunt for a server inside and ask where the patio server was . I let that person know we have been waiting for about 10-15 minutes and have n't been approached for anything . This server was happy to go out of her way and at least get our drinks . She was friendly and was hoping she would be our server and not the normal outside patio server . Well , unfortunately the regular outside patio server ended up being our server for the night . We then tried being optimistic about it and went and ordered both our drinks and food because who knew when she would come around to check in . Well , later the night came and another 15 minutes or so go by without our server coming around to ask if we wanted anything . I ended up going to the bar outside and was about to order when FINALLY the server came and asked if she could help . Whelp , another awkward moment between the server and us . \n\nLater that night , she came around once more and said she was closing out and if she could close our table . We said \ '' '' '' '' Yes\ '' '' '' '' . Let 's just say that her overall service deserved a at most $ 1 tip just because I felt bad , but did give her a 10 % tip because I 'm not that mean . \n\nOverall , the food , was OK , the drinks were OK ( little watered down on mixed drinks ) and the customer service AGAIN was horrible .

You can bet but need to go somewhere else to watch them . Sportsbar attached is nice with many beers to choose from .

25045,"While in Vegas last week , I got a sudden urge for some Banh Mi and Chicken Pho and of course , almighty Yelp led us to Lemongrass Cafe.\n\nYeah , yeah , the outside looks like a 50 's diner , actually now that I think of it , it kind of resembled an oversized Streamline trailer . But hey , who cares , you 're there for the food , not to play Architectural Digest trivia.\n\nTheir menu was quite extensive as it had your basic Vietnamese and Thai offerings along with , Banh Mi ... yay ! Talk about a perfect trifecta of Asian food ! So , I order my Chicken Pho and I shared the Combo Banh Mi with the s/o . Pricing was a little bit on the high side compared to the Bay Area , my Pho was pushing $ 7 and the Banh Mi was $ 3.75.\n\nOur Banh Mi took awhile to make , not sure why but when it came out , I was slightly disappointed . It 's thickness was mostly the bread 's doing but it was also short but oh well . I took a bite into it and the sandwich redeemed itself , it was quite delicious for such a small thing . The bread was tasty , not sure if they bake it on site but it sure tasted like they did . But , still disappointed about how small it was . When it comes to Banh Mi , size certainly matters , the longer the better , right ? ; ) \n\nMy Chicken Pho was good , pretty basic , ca n't really mess it up . However , my bowl had a lot of chicken . Usually , my general complaint on most food I eat is how skimpy the meat is , well , not my bowl of Chicken Pho , it was loaded ! \n\nThe staff was really friendly . This one girl who was our server , whoa , talk about stewardess in the making ! She exerted such overwhelming friendliness , courtesy and hospitality.\n\nOverall , Lemongrass Cafe was a decent place to eat and worth going to get your Viet/Thai/Banh Mi fix on !",2,neutral
15727,"`` It really pains me to have to write this re-review . But I feel if I do n't I would be doing a disservice to all Charlotte Yelpers who may find themselves in the same horrible , horrible , dining experience I had this afternoon.\n\nI used to LOVE this place . I used to suggest it to all my friends , raving about the great NY style pizza , great atmosphere , and great service . Today I feel like I ate at a completely different restaurant . \n\nHostess was very sweet , cleaning off a table for us outside . We were sat , and then we sat . and sat . and sat . No one came over to even acknowledge us . After finally tracking down our waitress , we placed our drink orders and and ordered Mozz sticks app . About 10 min went by . Then 15 , and I started wondering if they were brewing my beer behind the bar . As i sat there waiting for our drinks for about 20 min , I started noticing a few weird things about our waitress \ '' '' '' '' New Lisa\ '' '' '' '' as it said on our receipt . She was honestly acting like she had taken something the night before , or that morning who knows , and it was still in her system for sure . Seemed like she was just wandering around lost , every table she had was constantly asking for refills , their check , etc ... . There was something way more wrong there than her just being \ '' '' '' '' new\ '' '' '' '' . \n\nWhen our food finally made it , she could n't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE . And to top it all off the food was disgusting . Mozz sticks were obviously frozen , sauce had no flavor . I got chick parm stromboli , it came out soggy , somewhat cold , and just gross . My wife got the meat ravioli , she said they were ok , probably frozen as well , but the sauce they were buried in was pretty unbearable . I remember fresh ingredients from this place , no more ... ..\n\nI do n't know if something major has gone on here in the past 6 months or so , but I will never be back after this experience . When you have 2 full plates of food left sitting on the table , I literally took 2 bites , and no one says anything it speaks miles about the apathy of this restaurant. , staff , & ownership.\n\nKnowing its the same ownership group of some other local favorites of mine , I will not be supporting any of their food until the issues are addressed and big changes are made . I will make sure everyone I know who has eaten at this restaurant is well aware of the type of service and food this establishment offers.\n\nExcuse me while I morn the loss of one of my favorites .

I do n't know about you guys but when I get a burrito I would like all the fillings to be in every bite .

I had to order extra guacamole on the side even then they did n't even fill the small container up . They did at first then scooped the guacamole out so it was more hollow in the center .

It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served out . I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one . BOO ! Anyhoo ... ... we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn . It was fried nicely and not too oily , but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning . It came oddly with a cucumber dip ( I think it was creamy cucumber dressing ) we asked for ranch instead . It just tasted off . I ordered a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again , no rosemary . My chicken was dry and boring . I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses . AGAIN , nothing but bad to say about both these items . FIRST . Frozen cut broccoli should never be served at any restaurant . I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh . Next , garlic mashed potatoes . Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness . These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt . When I asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said \ '' '' '' '' oh yes no we do n't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies\ '' '' '' '' OMG ! What a joke ! CREAM is the best thing about em ! what would be the point otherwise ? I told them they should tell people this before they order . She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead .

The Bakery Cafe is a place I 've been to a few times and had reasonable success with , though I tend to prefer Spotted Donkey upstairs . \n\nOn my last visit , however , I walked out in disgust . After looking over their elaborate-sounding Sandwich menu , I had a sudden desire for a specific , basic sandwich , and asked for it . I was told I had to order from the menu . Why ? the restaurant was almost empty , and my sandwich request was as simple as it comes ( BLT ) in terms of ingredients ( I saw they had bacon in their sandwiches ) . I did n't care how much they charged me for it - they could have said $ 10 and I would have been fine with that . We ended up going upstairs to Spotted Donkey and dropping $ 50 for a lunch instead - business they could have had . The sandwich menu looked great , do n't get me wrong - I just did n't fancy anything on it that day and had a desire for something simple . \n\nThe server was sour-faced and unhelpful .

Long story short , I was offered a wax and declined . Next he commented on dirt marks on the interior door , and the leather seats . He said as he was tapping my drivers seat \ '' '' '' '' we can make these look like new\ '' '' '' '' he also said that they were going to \ '' '' '' '' clean everything\ '' '' '' '' . It also sounded like he said something about leather conditioner for the seats , but I 'm not sure because his accent was very thick . I figured I could use those services because the car is two years old , and the leather could use a cleaning . I agreed to that , and went inside to pay . The cost of the interior clean upgrade was significant , and I was expecting the job would reflect the cost of the service . The inside is nice . There are comfortable couches inside and TV . About 20 to 30 minutes pass , and my car was ready . I go out to look at the job they did , and it was very obvious that they did absolutely nothing to the seats . The rest of the interior was pretty clean but it was n't an amazing job either . I commented on how the seats were n't cleaned to the guy who takes the ticket . His response was \ '' '' '' '' no , that is something different.\ '' '' '' '' I told him that the guy at the entrance said that the seats would be cleaned as well . The only cleaning they did on the interior was : the windows , vacuum and Armor All on the inside . I would have liked to talk with the manager about the issue , but did not have the time .

49936,"Yes ! The Yelp gods finally granted my wish ! A Yelp wine event ! Horray ! Do n't get me wrong , the events at breweries are amazing , but I 'm a proud Wine-o . No shame ! As soon as I saw this event I knew I was going to love it . \n\nI 've heard great things about the Pittsburgh Winery and I 'm excited Yelp brought me here because I know I 'm going to be returning . It is a beautifully modern space that has such a cozy and warm vibe from the second you walk in . Dim lighting is my fav because it totally makes the atmosphere chill AND makes you look better ( fluorescent lights are not my friend ) ! Ha ! The red colors , barrels lining the walls and interesting art totally added to the feel of it all . I kept mentioning how awesome it would be to spend a Friday night here rather than dealing with the craziness of any old bar . It was a bit crowded , making hard to get through with all of the tables , however it was n't overbearing and I still had enough room to have conversation with my boyfriend , Meghan B. and her plus one , Liz . \n\nThe wine was very good ! Unfortunately I only sampled two of their reds , but I quickly found that their Red Blend was going to be my choice for the night . Prices were a bit steep , but I suppose $ 8/glass is really average around the city . I do wish they would have had more of a selection and had some more sweeter options , but I was content with what I had . \n\nThe wine decorating was cool and my boyfriend totally did our glasses up REAL fancy . I was much more interested in having conversation with my fellow Yelpers ! I ca n't do two things at once apparently . \n\nOnto the food . My favorite of the night had to be Gaucho ( obviously ! ! ) . I can not wait to visit their shop . The pork dish was amazing . The dressing was simply fantastic . I was n't a fan of the horseradish dish , however everyone at my table was raving about it . I guess I 'm just not a horsey person ? The bread from Great Harvest was so good ! I loved the rosemary loaf . It was grainy and wonderful . \n\nI 'm so happy Yelp brought me here and I ca n't wait to visit again perhaps during a performance . Thanks so much , Rachel !

The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend , the specials a little more glamorous , and the alcohol a little tastier . \n\nWe went two nights in a row , and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers . The pizza I ordered was good but not great , but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding . The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil , and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with . The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix ... Seriously , fungi ? Never have I had that in bruschetta before . Whatev . \n\nLast night , the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries , and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them , he comped them , but brought them out as a bonus .

It can be a long wait to get served . Being a big muffin fan I always loved the apple cinnamon and blueberry muffins and they are consistently good.\n\nThe Paradise rewards are a nice perk , compared to other coffee shops it is easy to earn free drinks and food if you are a regular and would spend the money anyway.\n\nThe only reason this location looses one star is the sometimes pushy home business folk that take over every available booth and camp with their laptops . This is during the week . On weekends you get whole families with screaming kids . This does not seem to happen at the other locations in the area , could be the proximity to the hotel next door .",3,positive

And it 's BYOB ! \n\nI 've been here for a quiet date night , a birthday dinner , and a random not celebrating anything at all group dinner and every time is as good as the last , if not more so.\n\nI like to describe it as an Asian style Melting Pot , except way better . It provides the unique , always enjoyable opportunity to cook delicious food w/your friends , but w/out the hefty price tag . Plus the ambiance is great and the soundtrack is always groovy.\n\nThere are several different broth and small plate options so every time I 've gone it 's been a different concoction , which is nice , but I 'd have to say my favorite to date is the lemongrass . I also love dipping the meats in their side sauces w/a dab of Sriracha , mmm . There is a corking fee for the alcohol but it 's a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things .

26178,"Noca is a great place for a date . It is a culinary experience , with all its style . The chefs are working extremely hard right in front of you and they have many interesting things on the menu . We had appetizers of the duck confit and some sort of sashimi . The duck confit was great and had some really fun elements , like the huckleberry waffle ( ? ) first for me . The sashimi special was awesome as well . we also received a small sample of a duck mousse , tasted like tuna and mayo , which was alright and some cauliflower soup , yum ! I had the duo of Berkshire Pork , which was highly recommended by the waiter . It was good in an artsy sort of way , but I was n't completely blown away . It said it came with brussel sprouts , but it was really 3 leaves of brussel sprouts , haha funny . The pork chop was n't so great , apples added depth though , and the pork belly I did n't care for . The demi was good though . The donuts for dessert were pretty good as well . I liked the dulce de leche dip . They gave us some homemade shortbread to take home , very good . The service was wonderful . I did wait at the bar and was suggested a very nice sauv by the bartender . The place is so tiny , reservations are a must , we had to sit outside , but it was a lovely night . I wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot . Managers did come up frequently to check on us and gave some insight and great suggestions .

But he ca n't fool the real foodies . \n\nWhen you have cotton candy ( as you see at circus and third class joints on main street ) as a main attraction it speaks much for the creativity of the chef . The meat was not over cooked or under cooked ... just not cooked . Raw meat brought to the table ( from which school did this man acquire the fine culinary skills needed to transfer the raw meat from the wholesale supplier on to the table ) and it was so revolting I turned from a carnivore to a vegan and even took up yoga and meditation . However the memory of the uncooked morsel of meat , still sends shivers and anti-peristalsis down by food pipe to this date.\n\nThe truck taco stand at gas stations is hundred times better than this dump . The rock star chef with long hair is seen cooking without a head cover in social magazines and TV shows .

34855,"Peters yard is a Swedish cafe which does really good food . I would love to come here for breakfast every week , but I would quickly go into overdraft . There are many beautiful pastries , biscuits , cakes , loaves of bread and open sandwiches on display . There are also daily 'pizzas ' and soups , and you can get homemade ice cream in the 'food to go ' section around the back , though I must emphasize that Peters yard main claim to fame resides in their fantastic baked goods . \n\nThe cardamon and cinnamon buns are somewhat famous in Edinburgh , as they are so good ! They are also authentic . I have eaten the same buns in Norway and Sweden , and these were very similar ... or dare I say it , better ? They are light , not too doughy , and enriched by a delicious spiced sugar . Even better ( in my opinion ) are the fruit buns : you get the same delicious pastry , but with custard cream and entire raspberries or blueberries . Wash that down with a cardamon hot chocolate or a cappuccino , and you have the breakfast of dreams.\n\nPeters yard caters for most diets , offering a few vegan cakes , soya milk , and a few gluten free options . The building is made with glass , and therefore unsurprisingly lets a lot of light into the room . This combats SAD which is almost inevitable during a Scottish winter . There are quite a few recipe books which are interesting to browse whilst waiting for your food . Every time I go there I get it into my head that I am going to start baking Nordic pastries ! \n\nPeters yard is conveniently located on the edge of the quartermile development , between the University of Edinburgh and the meadows . This makes it ideal for student socials , picnics in the park and quick snacks.\n\nMy only problems with peter 's yard : \n\n1 . The price-I end up spending about \u00a310 here for a light breakfast.\n2 . The non-baked goods . They are not bad , per se , but this is not the expertise of Peters yard . I am a big fan of thin and crispy pizza , and find the pizzas here way too thick and starchy . The soup is n't bad either , but it 's something which I make better at home for a fraction of the price . I have looked at the open sandwiches often in awe , then shied away after seeing the steep price tag.\n\nOther than that , this is a really great place for fresh bread , cakes , and above all PASTRIES ! It is a luxury though , and I ca n't imagine being able to afford coming here all the time .",3,positive

44229,"`` Suffering from a mild bout of cabin fever , my daughter and I decided to brave the arctic conditions and grab some spicy food at A La Brasa . I reviewed the menu options online before our visit and had a couple Peruvian-influenced items in mind when we walked through the doors . However , the restaurant now describes itself as a \ '' '' '' '' Mexican Grill\ '' '' '' '' , so it was time for a quick change of plans ( note to management - please update your online menu ) .\n\nAfter seating us , our server dropped off a basket of standard-grade corn chips and a bowl of pico de gallo . The chips were heavily salted and were nothing to write home about . The pico de gallo was excellent - it was loaded with fresh onions , cilantro and tomatoes along with a healthy dose of jalapenos . My only problem with it was the bowl was too small and every time we tried to use a chip to scoop some out , most of the contents ended up on the table . Because of this , we soon ran out of pico de gallo , but our server was too engrossed with a cell phone call to notice that we needed a refill . \n\nAfter adjusting to the new menu , I decided about the beef version of the Cemita Poblana sandwich ( $ 10 ) . The sesame-encrusted bun was a disappointment ; it had the texture of a hamburger bun from the local Piggly Wiggly . Also disappointing was the beef cutlet - too little beef and far too much of the greasy breading . I did enjoy the rest of the sandwich , which included loads of buttery oaxaca cheese , slightly sweet caramelized onions , spicy chipotle peppers and perfectly ripe avocados . \n\nThe $ 7 cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter became a comedy of errors . She is a vegetarian and the first version of her cheese quesadilla was peppered with small chunks of chicken . We flagged down another server ( our initial server was still busy on his cell phone ) who apologized for the error and promised to make a cheese-only version . It came ten minutes later , but this time , the thick corn tortilla was a soggy mess . ( I wonder if it sat on the counter too long , since the first quesadilla did not have this problem . ) The replacement quesadilla also lacked a serving of the salsa verde that added some much needed zip to this dish . We again flagged down a server , and after another wait , we received the green salsa . By then the whole thing was getting cold - ugh . While my daughter did enjoy the melted oaxaca cheese , she stated she strongly preferred the $ 3 Los Gemelos version of this dish . With no sides , this dish was a poor value.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was extremely clean , flooded with natural light and nicely decorated . \n\nOverall , the negatives of my visit ( spotty service , lackluster food ) outweighed the positive ( superb pico de gallo ) . With so many other great , local options for Mexican food , I doubt that I will be paying A La Brasa a return visit . ''",1,negative

First of all their concept of HH is wrong . Charging a dollar or 2 less than the same dinner item is not a Happy Hour . Nor is charging $ 2 less for an inferior wine that does n't even appear on the regular wine list ! Thats just robbery.\nWhen the waiter came over I pointed to 2 wines on the list and asked what they were ... 'wine ' he said . i should have got up and left right then ! \nAnd the food ... as disappointing as the service . We ordered the Mussels in a savory tomato sauce . Half the Mussels were 'off ' and the bread was a soggy , greasy fried lump . Where is a nice chunk of fresh italian artisan bread ? Next was the $ 11 ribs . Obviously heated up from the night before they were tasteless , dry and overcooked . The coleslaw accompaniment however was simply heavenly.\nThe Bruschetta was not toasted but 'fried ' on the griddle so the taste of the old grease permeated the bread .

I also regularly asked , \ '' '' '' '' Why is this happening ? \ '' '' '' '' \nMuch of the play is exposition . LONG exposition . At these times , there is no joy , no humor , and no smiling . \nMost of the rest of the play is spend with a nod to the fact that the \ '' '' '' '' Old Fart\ '' '' '' '' is portrayed by a weird , giant puppet upper-torso , operated by the over-worked actor giving this play ( and his many different parts in it ) his all . At times the torso is abandoned to sit on the stage as the actor plays another part . Everyone winks and nods and plays up the fact that the production is too ... cheap , I 'm guessing ... to just hire an old man actor to play one of the most central figures in the story.This becomes unbearable as the Rick character carries on ad nauseum about his dad , when the \ '' '' '' '' old Fart\ '' '' '' '' should be out there telling the story himself.\nAs if all of this were n't tedious enough , there is a multi-media aspect in the videos they cut to from time to time . These are rudimentary at best , but there is a dream sequence the with \ '' '' '' '' Chumlee\ '' '' '' '' character where he 's fighting ninjas for no reason that goes on to the point where I thought I might lose my mind.\nThe production ends with a rousing musical number about how you should bring your stuff to them because they want to but it .

During check in we received a smoking room because it was the only one available but they said some people do n't smoke in the room . The room was definitely bad but to be expected considering it was a smoking room anyways.\n\nOther than that our rooms were clean and housekeeping always came late in the day around 2pm or later . We did have some problems in just one room where the bathroom lights turned off . We called maintenance and they told us to press the reset button . Three calls later they finally worked but we also told maintenance that our shower head had no water pressure . Within an hour they had someone up to fix it and it was a lot better . The hotel room was spacious but had absolutely no drawer space , the bathrooms are quite large and having a separate bath and shower was definitely nice . The toilet had a door but had no fan or light switches from inside . The pool sucks so stay elsewhere if that 's a priority.\n\nOverall this hotel was great for the price and the convenience of having the miracle mile and earl of sandwich was one of the main reasons why we chose to stay here .

6943,"I take my Yelp reviews very seriously . To me , giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious , that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result . Oh wait ... that 's exactly what happened . I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother , his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding . We rented an SUV with a car seat . Initially , my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them , as they were unfamililar with this model , and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat . Fine . No big deal . We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day . \n\nMy brother 's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just would n't go away . Finally , he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact , unsafe to hold a child . A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT , we were informed that it was not negligence on their part , it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided . Are you counting ? We have two strikes so far . Massive error that could have led to death of child ( that 's got ta count for at least 10 strikes though ... right ) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem . The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location , and they said we could come and pick up a new seat . They gave us a new seat , they sure did . Once again , I kid you not , this one was missing clips . \n\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport . The staff were rude , and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we 'd never seen before . I understand they ca n't actually install it for liability purposes , but I ca n't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car . Regardless , we never once received an apology , just continued rude behavior and eye rolls . I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency . You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine , my family 's or any of my friends ' business again . You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street . This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation .",0,very negative

24121,"I 've only had one cupcake from here , so this is based on very limited experience . But , in my one visit I formed a 3-star opinion . I came in around 9:30 on a Friday night . There were 4-5 cupcake flavors to choose from plus a brownie and maybe three different types of cookies . The setup of the shop is a little weird in that the cupcakes are displayed on the side , so if this place ever got busy and a line formed it would be a little chaotic to see which cupcakes were available and then actually get in line in front of the register . The menu was posted on the wall adjacent to the display case , but I did n't even notice it until I had my cupcake and was sitting down.\n\nBut those are minor issues . I ordered a vanilla cupcake and took a seat . The cake itself was dry and the cupcake was way overpriced at $ 2.99 for being so small . The saving grace of my purchase was the icing . It was delicious ! The sugar sprinkles on top were a great touch . I 'd come here again for a cupcake , but I find the high pricetag really annoying and a major put-off.\n\nCream & Flutter has cocktails in addition to milk , coffee , and tea . This makes me wonder if they are trying to position themselves as a place to hang out instead of a place to go just to wolf down a treat . If the former then the interior needs work . It 's a bit stark and the chairs are n't the most comfortable to just sit and relax . A cozier atmosphere would be more conducive to sipping a cocktail and staying there longer .

The space is large , the amenities are clean and they have several food options at the cafeteria and now just catered options . They actually have restaurants who serve food . \n\nHowever , this is the reason the Phoenix Convention Center gets three not four stars . The parking for the convention center is $ 12 . Normally , people already pay to get into the event and I think that if you pay to attend an event at the Phoenix Convention Center , parking is included . I 'm not sure if other conventions center do it this way , but it 'd be nice if they did !",2,neutral
11264,"There are *way* cheaper all you can eat sushi deals in Vegas than here if you 're looking to be on the conservative side with your hard earned money . I do n't know about anyone else , but unless the sushi quality is top notch and the dining experience comes with the 360 degree service and quality , I absolutely refuse to pay $ 25- $ 28 for all you can eat when I know I can get it for at/under $ 23 elsewhere where I do n't have to wait 20/30 minutes to be sat . \n\nWhile their sushi and plates are interesting , I honestly do n't see anything overly special about this place . Small , always seems to be mobbed , and while the service is good , it is nothing overly outstanding like some of my friends raved to me about.\n\nThe reason why I gave it three stars is because 1 . ) The prices are a little over the top for something you can get cheaper ( and in a better setting ) somewhere else , and 2 . ) This place is always busy , and the wait times are very much over-quoted and long .",2,neutral
30579,"`` Went Friday to take advantage of the special lechon ( roasted pig ) . \nI found the cafe cozy- nice , dark wood furniture and dark wood blinds . Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler ! I found the high counter a little daunting- I , being only 5 feet tall , had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down , or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter , and have a look through the sneeze-guard . Their labeling system needs improvement : I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line . I 'm sorry , but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order , food laid out in huge trays and placed in \ '' '' '' '' turo-turo\ '' '' '' '' style IS N'T food cooked-to-order ! \n\nHere is a list of the food I tried that day : \n\n1 . Lechon , large order $ 6.99- includes corn tortilla ( I subbed flour ) and choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice . ( I chose Filipino , of course ! ) http : //www.yelp.com/bizphotos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix ? select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg # SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg\n\n2 . 3-entree combo of Dinuguan ( \ '' '' '' '' chocolate stew\ '' '' '' '' ) , Beef Mechado , and Pork Adobo $ - includes garlic rice . http : //www.yelp.com/bizphotos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix ? select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ # Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ\n\n3 . Lumpia shanghai ( fried Filipino pork eggrolls ) - small order includes 8 pcs . of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried . http : //www.yelp.com/bizphotos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix ? select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ # HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ\n\n4 . Halo-halo $ 4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans , coconut strings , coco jellies , ube ( taro-based pudding ) , coconut milk , choice of ice cream , and shaved ice . http : //www.yelp.com/bizphotos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix ? select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA # cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA\n\n5 . Pan of cassava $ 8- Cassava is a root , much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream , butter , eggyolks , and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish . Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie ... A little help here , Joel ? \n\n6 . To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan , each $ 3\n\nI found all the entrees and eggrolls , save the mechado ( meat was a little tough ) , very tender and very tasty ( loved the dinuguan ! ) . However , they 're ALL very greasy , unfortunately ! I 'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again ... Everytime I ate them , they came back to haunt me , and all due to the high grease and salt content . A coworker came for her first visit ( with her husband and stepdaughter . as well ) after I had left , and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty , as well as the other dishes she tried there , but could n't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet . Karen , Rey , and Purine , as well as Michael , were all very friendly and accomodating , this is true.\n\nI would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again , but I wo n't eat any of it until I 'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat , reheat , and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time . Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes . They are very tasty , but I have to be careful ... Or I could enjoy them fresh , but without much of the sauce.\n\nWhat my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we 'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again ! This dessert , similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau , tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients , instead of from a bottled mix of beans , coco strings and jello . I liked the ice cream they used , too . You have your choice of either ube , vanilla , or mango . I 'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors ... As a special , Karen had prepared ginataan , a warm dessert consisting of plantains , jackfruit , coco strings , taro , and something akin to yams , cooked in coconut milk and sugar . This looked and smelled so very good , but I could n't try it due to food allergies . I wonder if Joel had a sample ? I know he enjoyed the cassava ... I did , likewise.\n\nAs for the lechon , I 'm sad to report that the skin was n't crispy at all , and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin . It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like . A faint hint , but still there , nonetheless . The pork meat did n't wow me , either . A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce , which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler ( or at Mekong in Mesa ) . Awesome sauce , just ask Joel ! I 'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce ( I stayed away from it bec . I was n't sure of the ingredients at the time ) .\n\nI will definitely be back to try their daily specials . I do hope that Karen and the others strive to lessen the grease content of their dishes ... ''",2,neutral
45464,"`` The company was stellar . And after 2 hours and 15 minutes of 'meh ' everything else , I was still smiling . So , kudos to my fellow diners ! In hindsight , I 'm surprised we were only there for 2 hours and 15 minutes , because it felt much longer . What 's tough about the layout of Matteo 's is that there is NOwhere to go if your table is n't ready . There 's no real host stand to speak of ; and the rest of the restaurant is full of tables and a lovely bar with little room for anything or anyone else . When the weather outside is frightful , as it was this evening , you 're screwed and have to spend however many minutes dodging servers and other patrons as you wait . But moving on . \n\nWe were seated by a friendly hostess who opened with a list of accolades that Matteo 's had recently received . An odd opening , in my opinion , but after her illustrious description I figured we were in for a real treat . A few minutes later our server arrived to take our drink orders . A few more minutes later she arrived with waters . A few more minutes later she returned with wine . Lots of minutes involved here . Then we ordered . Our visit was during Restaurant Week , and I have taken that under careful consideration - I promise . The 3-course menu looked delightful , and from it I selected Mussels Marinara , House Salad and Cod . As we waited the restaurant filled quickly and the singular aisle became congested since there was simply nowhere to stand . Some people left , some stayed . That 's neither here nor there . \n\nWe remained focused on anxiously awaiting our bread which , arrived several minutes later . It was clearly right out of the oven , so the wait for that was understandable . Many , many minutes later we received our first course . The mussels - straight outta the Morgantown river - if there is such a river . I adore mussels and I 'm used to their texture , taste , etc . These were BAD . So fishy due to the lack of quality sauce , which was a can of tomato paste/sauce/whatever , if I were to guess . Another \ '' '' '' '' many minutes later\ '' '' '' '' we received our second course ; a passable house salad . Nothing fancy ; nothing bad - no complaints here . Our third course arrived sometime after the place mostly cleared out and both myself and one of my companions who ordered the same dish ( cod ) found it inedible . Such a shame to such a brave fish . Those cod ; they just have Long John Silver 's written all over'em . But , when done right , they can be the king of fish . Not this cod . This cod obviously had a rough life sitting under a pound of the aforementioned \ '' '' '' '' sauce\ '' '' '' '' for much too long and arrived tableside as pure mush . I 'll be honest - I thought I might just suck it up and say nothing . It was getting late and I just was n't in the mood to explain or ask for something else . But one of our other dinner companions encouraged us to express our displeasure and she was right to do so . Granted , this meal was a cool 20 bucks - a STEAL for a night out - but I 'm pretty sure we overpaid by about $ 19 , and so something had to be said . The server offered something in its place , but the entree portion of the Restaurant Week menu was limited ( understandable ) and the other two options did n't appeal to me . So , I took one of them home for my lucky man , who I 'm sure will be THRILLED to throw it down once he reads this review . Actually , I took a bite and it was the best thing I 'd had all night . \n\nAll things considered , I did n't feel much concern from the server about our collectively poor experience , but I was just happy to leave . We were in such a rush to leave that I left my scarf and my friend left her phone . The server did walk the phone outside , which was a very nice thing to do . Thank you . In other news - there are far too many awesome place in L'Ville and beyond to waste my time returning to Matteo 's . ''",0,very negative

46956,"`` Sports bars with great service are bank in my book . Often , I visit ones where the rowdy action that 's happening on TV and throughout the bar gives servers an excuse to neglect your dining needs or act hurried in their interactions , but I 'm pleased to say Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers in Old Town Scottsdale is a great exception to this rule.\n\nI went there recently to watch the Indiana Pacers beat the Miami Heat ( woo ! ) and had a great time chilling out on the mister-filled patio . We had prime seating in front of a large flat-screen television and a cool view of Old Town Scottsdale . Now I know why the patio is constantly packed whenever I drive by - the place has great food , a killer happy hour , 25 TVs and service with a smile.\n\nOne of the things that 's greatest about Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers is that their happy hour lasts until 7 p.m. , and starts at 3 p.m . It features great specials , including $ 3 domestic pints and $ 5 appetizers . \n\nAs the restaurant name implies , the beer list is huge , but my favorite part about the meal was the delicious grilled cheese sandwich and side salad . The sandwich comes with fries or chips for $ 8 , and with my salad , it was only $ 10 . This was great bar food , a huge portion , with three types of cheeses and tomato . I added avocado , which is my favorite way to have it . I was impressed with the fresh salad , and left taking half my sandwich home.\n\nMy companion 's Turkey Burger ( $ 12 ) also looked generous , and he said it tasted graet . I stole some of his sweet potato tots ( an extra $ 2 ) , and they were worth the splurge - perfectly crispy and , again , a massive portion that had him taking half the meal home . \n\nThroughout the night , I was pleasantly surprised any server that passed by our table checked on us . Servers should work as a team , helping out each other 's tables with whatever they need , and that 's the philosophy here - really impressive.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun , with friendly banter and cheering among tables for the games .

36585,"Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market , this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan ( or as I like to call it , Foodie Island ) . \n\nSoybean milk- this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal , this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies . For those with discernible palates , I 've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball ( Fan Twan ) - a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school , do n't be fooled by the simple name . This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung . The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it 's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball ( Ba Wan ) - not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this , and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item . Finely chopped mushrooms , bamboo , and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise , this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child , this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup- Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more , the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens , cilantro , scallions , and bok choy . Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy ( in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking ) , otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives , scrambled egg , tofu , and mung bean noodles , this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts ( yiotiao ) and the sesame bun ( sao bing ) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side , and the hunk of pork in the pork bun ( gua bao ) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness ( Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy ) . Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice , sweet tofu custard ( do hua ) , and the lotus wrapped tamales ( taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available ) on future visits . \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights , CA ( the fonts on the food signs look similar ) , but if you 're expecting the same level of quality , it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high , otherwise it 's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated . Unbelievable value for your wallet but do n't forget cash if you 're spending under $ 10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex .",3,positive
10465,"What 's up with all the bad reviews for this place ? I adore this place ... \n\nFirst off , they 've remodeled and I must say it 's rather lovely inside . But more importantly , the food really is fantastic -- well , if you ordered what I always get : ) \n\nI LOVE their starters . The seared scallops ( I have no idea if it 's a regular item or seasonal one ) are ridiculously good ! They are seared to perfection and burst with flavor . I 've also had their crabcakes , and they are divine . The portion is rather small , but the quality speaks for itself . OH ! AND THE LOBSTER BISQUE ! ! ! Best I 've ever had ... the soup itself was savory and loaded with lobster chunks . To top it off , there 's a wonderful pastry shell that tops the soup . I 'm telling you , get the Lobster bisque . You wo n't be disappointed . \n\nTheir steaks are served a la carte , which get 's a bit pricey . But let it be known that these are HUGE cuts . I had the ribeye done medium rare and it was delicious ! Perfectly seared on the outside , with a warm , red tender inside . I could n't be happier with it . I do n't care about the sides , as I 'd rather not waste stomach space , but the garlic mashed potatoes were tasty . \n\nNow , there is one matter that makes me tempted to knock this joint down a star -- -their desserts are absolutely atrocious ! I mean it ! If you 've read any of my other reviews , then you 'll know that I 'm a dessert fiend and I like my creme brulee ... .but boy is the creme brulee here total crap ! The dessert comes with three different types of creme brulee -- choclate , traditional , and I do n't even remember the third . Man , it 's gross . It 's super dense and thick . Stick a spoon down the middle , and it wo n't budge -- it 's that dense . Aside from the rock hard texture , the taste is just off . It 's really terrible . I ca n't image why they would serve such crap . \n\nBut I 'll be generous tonight and stick to the five stars . But heed my advice -- stay away from the desserts . \n\nI do hope that they redesign their dessert menu and put some effort into it . It 's just depressing ! \n\nOh , and as for the reviewer who was upset with the $ 150 kobe steak -- I 've been to plenty of places that do n't list the price . And they really do n't tell you unless you ask . Heck , I ordered swordfish at another establishment and was never quoted the price ( it turned out to be a whopping $ 45 ) . Seriously ... if you 're going to order something that does n't have the price listed to it , just assume it 's gon na cost a truckload of money . I do , and it serves me well . Or do n't be afraid to ask . I 've seen the kobe on their menu , and the price is never listed . In fact , I 've seen this at many restaurants .

The best thing about the sandwich was its generous size : the thing was absolutely massive and really filled me up . The ingredients were okay . The veggies did n't taste remarkably fresh , but they were perfectly acceptable . The centerpiece of the sandwich , the falafel , was not the best I 've ever had . The texture of the falafel was n't particularly great : the whole thing was fairly mushy . There was no contrast between the fried exterior and the usually much softer interior . The flavor profile , likewise , was not my favorite either . The falafel tasted quite a bit like pumpkin bread due to the spice combinations they 'd used . The flavor itself is n't bad , but it does n't belong in a falafel.\n\nThe curly fries were fine . They were just curly fries like you can get anywhere else.\n\nOverall , just average . I would go back if there were n't better options nearby.\n\nI should note that my roommate went with me and got a lamb/beef gyro . He was very impressed and said it was among the best gyros he 'd ever had . He was impressed with the size of the gyro for the price .",2,neutral

I know they are sliders but I was expecting them a tad bigger and maybe like 3-4 of them instead of two plain bite size burgers and four potato chips ? I ended up spending $ 20 for it with a soda , tax , and tip . I hate spending money on food and leaving unsatisfied ! The people I went with said their regular burgers ( I think they ordered the kobe beef ) were the best burgers they ever had so I will definitely come back here again to try one of their regular sized ones .

37172,"`` I waited about a week to write this review to see if my opinions would change ; and unfortunately they have n't . I hardly ever write negative reviews because I am a very \ '' '' '' '' forgiving\ '' '' '' '' customer . However this was one of the worst experiences ever.\n\nLet me start off by saying the atmosphere was very lively and upbeat which was great . This was our first time going to this place so I did n't have any preconceived notions about it . This was not just a dinner but this was a celebration dinner for my husband . I made reservations for 19 almost a week before the date of the dinner . I was told that this would n't be a problem and to confirm my appt the day before . I actually spoke with about 3 different ppl during that week and everyone still said everything was fine . \n\nWhen I got to the restaurant with my party we walked back to our table and it was 2 separate tables with our backs to the next table . If you have ever booked a dinner for family and friends , you would assume that you are all sitting together . Immediately I asked the waiter to see what can be done about this as I could n't believe no one thought to tell me . The waiter said there was nothing he could do so of course I went straight to the manager . The arrogance and horrible attitude that I encountered was disgusting ! ! ! I asked if they could please try and move tables around or accommodate us as this was a reservation that was held for almost a week . He did n't even try and said no there 's nothing he can do . I asked him why I was n't told this and he said \ '' '' '' '' we do not have to disclose that.\ '' '' '' '' I literally could n't believe that we were bringing them that much business and they treated me like I was walking in off the streets . \n\nI had to walk away from him as I could feel my blood pressure rising . A family friend went up to him and kept trying to get this worked out and needless to say he would n't even apologize . He then stated that he would give us champagne and desserts on the house . He never once came over to the table to apologize or even check on us . They kept saying there was no way to move the tables yet we thought of a TON of ways to get all of us together . \n\nThe dirty looks and rolling of the eyes by the manager and certain staff members was unacceptable to me . The sad thing is that the food was pretty good but because of the horrible service that we received , I would never step foot in this place . Others in the large party said the same thing as they could n't believe the horrible treatment we received . \n\nI have been to many restaurants around the world and I know what good food and service feels like . This was below average by far . If you are wanting to plan a large party or dinner with this place-RUN ! It was a nightmare ... ''",0,very negative

After tonight though , I 'll probably never return . \n\nMy husband ( this review is being written by Stephen 's wife , Celeste , by the way ) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out , especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons . Well we had never eaten inside the store and did n't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests . They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him . He was so grossed out that he could n't finish his meal ( and he 's not usually very squirmy about bugs ) . All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was \ '' '' '' '' bug ! bug ! \ '' '' '' '' as he pointed at the floor or tables . \n\nThe service was still very friendly , but our bag of chips was very stale ( they did replace them when I mentioned it though ) , and the place was generally filthy . I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area , because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I 'll be very surprised if we did n't ingest a few bugs . It 's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service ( certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner , but will not be now ) .

38385,"`` Phenomenal.\n\nIt was n't long ago that I mentioned to someone ( or maybe even on my review of The Counter or Brown Bag Grill , both in Los Angeles ) , that I wanted a similar custom built burger type restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt 's here , folks ! \n\nAlthough it is another american burger joint , they take it to the next level with their variety and quality . I just came back from their 10:30PM-11:30PM half off special ( which is pretty restrictive ... details later ) , and I immediately took my computer out to write this review ! \n\nThe restaurant itself is decently large . It 's located behind Uncle Sam 's Subs in the Waterworks Mall ( which is adjacent to TJ Maxx and Giant Eagle ) . Because of their slightly obscure location , they do have a bright red sign that stands out from the other white colored signs . There 's an \ '' '' '' '' outdoor\ '' '' '' '' dining area , with two large flames shooting upwards ( almost the force of a butane torch , but with flames 3 feet tall ) for appearance and a bit of utility . The ambiance is slightly dark , the exact lighting that I expected ( and the reason for my poor photography with my iPhone camera ) . With 12 LCD screens , 9 at the bar alone , there 's at least one TV where anyone in the restaurant can see . Good space planning ! \n\nBecause they appeared to close off half the tables after 10:30PM , we were told to take a seat at the bar . The bartender came and greeted us , telling us that it 's his first day , and also asking me where I heard of this place . Where ? Facebook . I saw that a fellow Fox Chapel facebook friend of mine \ '' '' '' '' liked\ '' '' '' '' this restaurant 's page on facebook , and when I saw the menu online , i knew i had to visit it ASAP.\n\nThrough the facebook photo captions , I saw that they offer Happy Hour from 4-6PM , Monday-Friday . This includes half off appetizers and some drink specials . The other sweeter promotion they offer is for the first three months only , presumably starting from their opening date ( 1/19/11 ) , and that is half off burgers , sandwiches , and appetizers from 10:30-11:30PM ( closing ) . Half off excludes the following : custom burgers ( boooo ) , any burger with bison , fish , or crab.. entrees ( like steak ) and steak salad . The rest was up for discount . this took a while for them to figure out , and i was already filling out my custom burger sheet before they stopped me.\n\nThe first appetizer that caught my attention when i was surfing the menu online was their Bangkok Steak Fries , i.e . portobello mushroom fries . The first and last time I tried it was at Bottega Louie in LA , and I 've been dying to try them again - Burgatory gave me this chance . It comes with a peanut sauce that was different from the chipotle aioli I tried it with the first time . The dish here took one large portobello mushroom , sliced it up , used tempura batter , and lightly fried it , allowing the flavor of the mushroom itself to stay around . I highly recommend this appetizer . We also got the nachos , and they were still pretty good , but slightly more forgettable than the portobello fries.\n\nOnto the entrees.\n\nI got a What-A-Jerk Chicken burger . I did n't realize until the moment I bit into it that they use ground chicken for this burger , which I actually preferred over a standard chicken breast . The burger was mindblowingly juicy , and had a lot of robust flavors , like the jamaican jerk rub on the chicken , the cilantro leaves which constituted all the greens on the burger ( so much cilantro ! ) , and banana ketchup . although the ground chicken probably was n't much healthier than the beef , it still tasted just as delicious . my friend had the Morty 's Steakhouse , which again was a pretty strongly flavored burger ( description from their site : \ '' '' '' '' Peppercorn Crusted Beef Burger with Horseradish Cheddar , Haystack Onions and Cabernet Sauce.\ '' '' '' '' ) Although i did n't take a bite of my friend 's burger , my friend said on the car on our way back home : \ '' '' '' '' this may be the one thing that will make me not hate pittsburgh.\ '' '' '' '' \n\nThere are so many more things on the menu that I still look forward to trying , but did n't have the space to fit in my stomach . Hard Shakes ( yes , alcoholic shakes ... what could be better ! ) , 12 beers on tap , a bunch of other bottled varieties , classic shakes ( if you call kona coffee and glazed donuts in a milkshake a classic shake ) , and most importantly , my own customized burger ( with bison or crab ) ! \n\nI was almost hesitant to actually submit this review because it 's been my best find in Pittsburgh so far . I 'm glad that I have a friend who has a car , so I can hitch a ride with him from shadyside/squirrel hill . It 's good that this place is n't too close to the colleges , which means that hopefully the crowd can be more manageable . As long as they keep the quality up , I can guarantee that this place is here to stay.\n\nPS Sorry for the poor picture quality . The pictures do n't do the food justice . I promise to bring my actual camera next time ! \n\nPPS I did n't know there was a 5000 character limit on reviews ! This is the first time I 've had to cut my review sh -- ''",4,very positive

Of course we did n't , so I called Cool Blew directly Saturday afternoon.\nI got the feeling that I was bothering them trying to schedule my appointment , and was then advised that someone would come out Monday between 2pm and 5pm.\nMoved my work schedule around so I could be home by 2 to wait . 5:30 comes around and finally get a call from the office that the tech is still at the other job and will be here shortly.\n7:15 rolls around and no one is here . We called Cool Blew and the guy my husband spoke with said he 's trying to get ahold of the tech , but the tech is n't answering his phone . He 'll call us back when he gets ahold of him . He called back a few minutes later and said that the tech still is n't done and it 'll be awhile longer.\nAt this point , we just cancelled the appointment . It 's not worth it , and the level of unprofessionalism is blowing my mind ! Yes , it 's Arizona and yes an A/C repair company will be busy - get more staff ! Get people to answer the phone who are n't bothered by customers . It 's pretty simple . Keeping in contact with us and being proactive could have avoided a lot of this frustration . If our home warranty company does n't have another option for a different company , it looks like we 'll just have to switch home warranty companies ! What a joke !",0,very negative

30032,"Firebirds is a mans restaurant . Dark wood , soaring stone fireplaces and attractive servers . The bar is a heavy black granite with dark wood accents . \n\nBusinessmen and corporate American Expresses are abundant , as is the selection of bourbons and gins . I like to have a dirty beefeater Martini with their blue cheese stuffed olives . They have a pretty nice wine list , which is half off on mondays . The beer list is lacking , your basic Blue Moon , Sam Adams , Stella selection . \n\nThe menu centers around meat entrees , and most entrees come with a loaded baker . One of the best loaded baked potatos I 've had . One complaint : the entrees do not come with a salad . For the price of most things , a salad is needed to justify it . \n\nThis is one of those restaurants I like to go to alone , sit at the bar , drink too much and have a big steak ... .go home and have the best nights sleep ever .",3,positive

It was n't horrible , but it was bland . Very bland . I expected spicy as the description stated , but its about as spicy as a spicy chicken from Wendys . The baby corn in the dish tastes like it was just taken out of it 's soaking liquid ( or can ) and thrown right in without being drained . It tasted very watery and has not absorbed any flavor from the gravy ( and yes I know the corn wo n't absorb much flavor at all ) .\n\nSince this restaurant is highly praised , I just going to have to come back another time .

48871,"I really dig this venue . The Roots were playing on the night I went - I arrived early to start the night off with drinks and some of their famous fried chicken . \n\nThe fried chicken was top notch . Loved the seasoning on it . Probably the best I 've had in this city ( Note : Vegas is n't really known for fried chicken ) . Super juicy , but not too greasy . Real good combo with some beer ( Magic Hat on tap ) . Came up to $ 20 for 4 pieces of chicken , collared greens , mashed potatoes , and a slice of white bread . Was n't too hungry so I shared it with a friend . Good stuff to munch on while waiting . You can either eat indoors or outdoors with a view of the Linq that 's great for people watching.\n\nAs a music venue , it 's really great too . It 's just an overall fun atmosphere to be around . Plenty of bars , lots of walking room , and a outdoor 2nd story patio for some air . I also liked the fact that you can get away from the stage to some seats where you can actually hear conversations with company.\n\nI did n't get to try out the bowling , but the alley looked really modern and trendy . More upscale than most bowling alleys that I 've seen.\n\nAll in all , a really great venue that offers a lot to do . It looks like they have some great artists lined up to perform in the future . I 'm definitely going to be dropping by here often .",4,very positive
22985,"This place was so-so from start to finish with two things that drop this place from a three-star to a two-star.\n\nThe first part was the service was very slow or at least our waiter was . His name was Jesus and he came over and introduced himself and took drink orders to start . The problem was he brought back the wrong drink for me , and his 5 oz pours were very stingy for the rest of my party . He told my gf that the beer she wanted they did not have and so he said he would get something else . We did not see him for another fifteen minutes and so we just grabbed another waiter who I asked to get me to get a different drink and order one for my gf . Also he took our orders . Jesus only showed after we got our new drinks.\n\nSecondly , why this is a two instead of a three is the price . When I buy a $ 60 stake I want to know I 'm eating a sixty dollar steak and sadly it was not up to that standard . If I paid $ 20 for it I think this place would deserve a three but for that price I was not blown away.\n\nOverall , this place is so-so , and for the price you can find something that you will absolutely love some place else in vegas .",1,negative

47087,"Hey Hop Doddy , You 're great 90 % of the time , but last night was not the best experience . Two quick notes : \n\n1 ) After waiting for 20 minutes and being at the head of the line , the hostess or seater tried telling us that they were all out of inside seating . I told them we would wait and then counted three empty booths inside . Do n't try to make a customer who has waited their turn sit in the heat ( yes , even with misters ) , if there are open tables . That 's dishonest and unfair . \n\n2 ) After resolving the whole table debacle there was still another wait because one of the cashiers left and was chatting and laughing with other staff members for a good five minutes ( with the line practically out the door ) . \n\nShow you deserve and know how to handle your popularity . Do n't seat outside unless you have to when it 's over 95 degrees . And communicate with your staff that the dinner rush is not the time for breaks . Just suggestions , other than that , keep up the good work .",2,neutral

One of them was way under average . I was told that the gentleman was blind . I would have thought it would have been even better after hearing that . You know , more attuned to the feel of a persons body needs through touch.\n\nTheir staff was very professional and friendly and very attentive while giving my space to relax and enjoy the space.\n\nThey have their own brand of body wash , shampoo and conditioner called Nurture . I did like the Oasis ' style better because each of the showers had a different set of fragrances in them and I think over the course of 4 days I used almost all of them - Lavender Citrus , Ocean Breeze , Cucumber and on and on.\n\nI do wish they would put the chaise lounges back next to the jacuzzi they were nice to relax on.\n\nI really look forward to going here each time I go to Las Vegas .

9647,"`` Meeting Space review only : Recently a group I 'm affiliated with rented the Arizona ballroom at the Gold Coast for an event . When I first heard of the location I was like \ '' '' '' '' Gold Coast ? Really ? \ '' '' '' '' Yes , really as in they really blew me away in a lot of different ways . From the minute we went up the escalator to the ballrooms things just worked and went off without a hitch . Also the sound quality was very good and exceeded my expectations by a long shot and did n't hurt my ears or leave me cringing as other places tend to do . They advertise that they are \ '' '' '' '' equipped with ultra-modern lighting and sound systems\ '' '' '' '' . I would n't go so far as to say ultra-modern but what they have flat out worked without fuss and was setup by someone who was very helpful and knew what they were doing . ( Turning out individual lights above our screens without having to ask is attention to detail that I really like ! ) Our meeting space was one of the better ones I 've been into at this size and price point in Vegas to date . And our food service was surprisingly good . If I wrote a Yelp review on the food service alone it would easily get 4 stars . ( Iced tea that tasted like tea , a Caesar salad that did n't taste like bulk salad , a main plate that most people in our group finished off , and even the chocolate and carrot cakes did n't last very long on a lot of tables . ) \n\nOverall my experience with the Gold Coast was not bad at all . I do wish they had variable message signing that could have welcomed our group like other places do . I also dislike the fact that many of our participants could n't find the Arizona ballroom without having to ask for directions . Internal casino signage for the rooms demands improvement . And the other group using the ballroom across the hall was an interesting group to have next to our professional group with invited media personalities and others C-List type local celebrities in their own minds running amuk . ( Excluding a certain local media person who is very much respected in our circles ) . But that 's a tangent and a story for another time . The Gold Coast is a great place to hold a meeting and I look forward to returning there in the not so distant future.\n\nDisclaimer : Some verbiage in this review was intentionally crafted to protect privacy while still giving me the opportunity to write a review .

We had to wait to be seated even though there was only about a handful of people there . We were seated in a booth and they are right when you really sink into the booths.\n\nIt took awhile for someone to come take our order , but when she came I was pretty excited to order . I decided to get the sampler plate with two beefs and a turkey since I ca n't eat tuna with a side of the zuchinni fries ! My husband got some kind of burger with an egg on top and sweet potato fries . My burgers were a bit dry , but the highlight of the lunch was the zuchinni fries ! I remember not liking the potato crisps last time , so I am really glad I went with the zuchinni . It was not over cooked and still crispy ! Yummy deliciousness . I did n't try my husband 's burger , but I would assume it was delicious since it was gone by the end of the meal . \n\nLunch came out to be about 35 bucks ?

Got here on a weekday a little after happy hour and was promptly seated outside . \n\nOur waitress was super friendly and attentive and had us ordering more drinks and food then we should have but it was worth it ! \n\nThe menu seems overwhelming at first as it looks like there are huge descriptions of each item that may or may not inform of what the dish really consists of ! My bf and I ended up sharing a couple of appetizers ( sriracha deviled eggs and sliders ) and ordered the mac and cheese with jerk chicken to share . Everything was delicious but the mac and cheese was amazing ! Soo good ! Really i think the mac and cheese here with anything will be amazing ! \n\nWe also started off with a couple of beers then we ordered a couple of rounds of the frozen cosmo . The frozen cosmos are super strong and delish . The fact that they are frozen makes it so refreshing on a hot summer day/night . Add a $ 1 and you can add more alcohol to it so be careful with these drinks ! They might hit you hard if you have too many ! \n\nTo finish things off we were convinced to get a hot cookie in a small cast iron pan loaded with ice cream ! The cookie was ooey gooey and delicious.\n\nI had an awesome night here and would love to come back for more delicious food and drinks !,4,very positive

HQ is in the same lot with this store makes them the defacto , if not actual , heir to the legacy of Glenn Bell : ) \n\nI had my first Taco Bell taco in Corvallis , Oregon in 1970 when I hit college with a mighty crash : ) \n\nIt was the second time I had ever had \ '' '' '' '' Mexican\ '' '' '' '' food..the first time was a week prior at a place called Taco Time in Eugene , Oregon.\n\nI was thrilled to find out about pizza , Italian food , pizza , Mexican , pizza , chinese take out , pizza ... you get the drift ... I was a country boy in the ( for me ) big city and I was going to find out all about life 's pleasures ... starting with taco 's : ) \n\nI was hooked on Taco Bell for a long time ( a time that , coincidentally , was the time when I had very little money yet still needed to eat occasionally : ) \n\nTaco Bell and the others filled the role of reasonably tasty maintenance eating for a long , long time ... it was a truism in 1975 that no one ... no one ... could eat $ 5.00 worth of Taco Bell at a sitting , all by themselves : ) \n\nCould.Not.Be . Done ! \n\nIt may still be \ '' '' '' '' truish\ '' '' '' '' with the \ '' '' '' '' cheapo\ '' '' '' '' menu : ) \n\nBut it has never really been very good : ( \n\nThat was something I actually did n't discover until a trip to LA with a girlfriend ( the same trip that I discovered In-n-Out : ) ... real Mexican food is very different than the goop that Glenn had sold me over the years ... and very much better : ) \n\nBut that did n't stop me from eating at Taco Bell ... beggars ca n't be chooser 's ... and I was a beggar for a few years.\n\nToday was a nostalgia stop for me ( as was my last visit to a Taco Bell a few years ago ) , as well as a tribute to Glenn : ) \n\nI was more interested in watching my \ '' '' '' '' beefy burrito\ '' '' '' '' being made this time ... the ladies in the kitchen pulled various levers in response to the computerized instructions for my order on the monitors overhead ... the different shades of unidentifiable goop that cascaded onto the flour tortillas ... the quick hand movements of their ritual wrapping of the burrito ( I once dated a girl that worked at Taco Bell ... she knew how to wrap a burrito ... but that 's another story : ) \n\nIt still is n't very good food ... but everyone at this location is sweet and pleasant , my order was correct , I was in severe need of a retox after a 6 miler this morning and I did manage to eat about 2/3 of the burrito ... even with mulitple \ '' '' '' '' bags\ '' '' '' '' of hot sauce it was not very good : ( \n\nBut that 's not the fault of the sweet ladies behind the counter , nor of Westaco , nor of Glenn Bell ... I think when Pepsi or YUM or whoever got their hands on Taco Bell ... well ... I 'm not writing this to get on a rant about corporate agendas vs. quality : ) \n\nI wanted to give them an extra star ... just for being who they are and where they are , but I hear the spirit of Glenn Bell telling me \ '' '' '' '' do n't do it , Donald ... make them earn it\ '' '' '' '' : - ) \n\nThat 's all I need , another voice in my head ... Thanks Glenn : ) ''",2,neutral

16399,"I love French cuisine ! ! ! I am so happy I found a home cooked French cuisine in Charlotte . I am so happy I finally experience this place ! My first impression as soon as I walk inside the door , I instantly feel warm , cozy and right at home . We had an early dinner on a Saturday night , probably the third table to be seated . The hostess immediately sat us at a very corner of the restaurant with a window view to the outdoor garden patio . My back was against the wall sitting on a very long wooden church bench , a pew . Within 30 minutes , the place was packed and the tables were filled up.\n\nI was hungry and saving my appetite all day . I proceeded to order a chicken liver salad that came with a nice warm poached egg on top . I also ordered a glass of risling . The moment I took my first bite , my palet were opening up to total heaven ! ! ! It made sitting on the church pew feel more heavenly . By far , one of the best salad I had in Charlotte ! ( True meaning of Yum Salad . It is a famous salad in South East Asia ) . If I can lick the juice of the plate , I would . Luckily for my date , the waitress brought the spoon for me to scrap every juice of the dressing left on my plate ! ! YUM ! ! ! By this time , the French owner came over and introduce himself as Fabrice ! Very nice guy.\n\nFor my main course , I ordered the duck breast with artichoke , cooked as the chef would recommend . The duck breast was plumb and juicy , slightly more cooked than what I was used to , but it was still delish ! The cream sauce was slightly heavy for me as I took my time sipping on my merlot chatting with my conservative attorney date who was not too familiar with French dining . He ordered overcooked steak and french fries ! Bless his heart ! \n\nI love this place and the location which is close to uptown and on a trendy mixed cultural district of Charlotte , Central Avenue ! !",3,positive

I 've tried it twice , once mixed ( lobster , crab , shrimp ) and once just crab . Liked both versions a LOT . Went back for this . But I hear the one at the Palace Station might be better . Will investigate , but NOT in a hurry.\n\nNEUTRAL\n- The \ '' '' '' '' special\ '' '' '' '' raw oysters . Tried the Kusshi and Kumimotos twice , thought they were good . THEN I got Kusshi 's at Comme Ca in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas after 10pm for CHEAPER ( a dozen at Tides was $ 20 , at Comme Ca $ 18 ! ) and the quality difference was STUNNING . I 'll only get half-shell product at Comme Ca ( after 10pm ) and BLUEHOUR ( happy hour $ 1 oysters ) from now on.\n- Shrimp cocktail . 5 large shrimp . Spouse had it this time , thought it was OK , thought $ 13 was high considering the $ 2.99 ones at Grand Cafe within Stations are just as good overall.\n- Gumbo . It was fine , but I preferred the Pan Roast.\n- Wine selection . OK selection , but expensive.\n\nCONS\n- Lobster Roll . Spouse got it this time around , shells throughout . Last bite was filled with shell , had to spit it out . Told the server , she did absolutely nothing . I said \ '' '' '' '' Well , guess it goes into Yelp ! \ '' '' '' '' \n- Etouffee . Just did n't do it for me . Preferred the Pan Roast.\n- Beer selection . Yeah , they give you 23oz beers for $ 6 , but nothing special.\n- Smoke . Altho it 's somewhat enclosed , it 's one of two restaurants in GVR that has access to smoke , and it shows . Spouse was sneezing like mad at one point , and said \ '' '' '' '' It 's the smoke\ '' '' '' '' . ( The SUSHI BAR in GVR is MUCH WORSE for smoke . It 's really ridiculous , serving sushi next to smokers at slots ! Whereas the steak house is ENCLOSED ! ) \n- Service . All four times , the servers are \ '' '' '' '' nice\ '' '' '' '' , some nicer than others ( actually , only one in four is nicely memorable ) . But no water offered , all four times . They take orders , bring food/drink , NO timing involved ( if you 're in the middle of something , too bad , here comes the next course ! ) , come by once per serving and ask/say \ '' '' '' '' EVERYTHING OK ? GOOD.\ '' '' '' '' and QUICKLY move on . When we were there today there was ONE server for the ENTIRE restaurant , counter AND tables , and I counted 20+ heads to serve . Really impersonal .

It definitely did n't taste fresh.\n- The veggies on the side to put on the burger were n't crisp . I usually like lettuce on my burger , but not their wilted lettuce.\n- The fries were n't seasoned and they were n't anything special .

22753,"`` This review is mainly in regards to their Fantasy Football Draft promo.\n\nLast year ( '08 season ) one of my fantasy football leagues saw an ad for hosting your draft party here , so we thought we would give it a try . It was pretty cool ... we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us . We also got a great draft kit that included a board ( we were able to hang it up on the wall ) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see . We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill . We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in '09.\n\nSo , this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation . The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone . I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date ( same guy , very accommodating ) . On the day of our draft , very different story . I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us . I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at . This would not do , especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board . I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager . I waited , and waited , and still no manager , so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down . Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us . I explained to her that we wanted to sit here , that we had been here last year ( same time at night ) and it was an ideal setup , and that one of our players was n't even 21 and able to sit in the bar . She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually , but not without threatening us with the police ! ! Oh , yeah , we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20 , and she 's telling us that there is a curfew on the strip ( mind you , we are no where near the resort corridor ) and if the police come in , its not her problem . Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving ... we said \ '' '' '' '' fine\ '' '' '' '' and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks . In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food . No discount either . One other thing , another fantasy football team was there that same night and did n't seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either ... they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.\n\nSo ... I am also in another fantasy league . For the last four years , this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe . This year , based on my experience from '08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW . After the experience with my first draft of '09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available . Of course , the manage ( the guy ) did n't have our reservation . What ! ! We made it three weeks prior ! ! good thing I called . Again , I got there early ( eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition ) . We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time ! woo hoo ! Lots more drinking and food this time ! Just as everyone shows up the manager ( a manager , not the lady from the previous draft ) informed us that they had no more draft kits ! Really ! ! Are you kidding me ! ! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits ! ! ! I was so embarrassed and pissed off . I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year . I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties ? ? BOO WILD WINGS ! ! ! \n\nP.S . I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo ... .your wings are NOT real buffalo wings ! ! ! \n\nP.P.S One star for the potato wedges with cheese and the really nice , attentive server we had the second draft of '09 .

1164,"`` This review is mostly for the Emergency Room . I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour . I rode my bike home , to ditch my computer and work files , and to make sure it was safe . Took a taxi to Good Sam , and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is \ '' '' '' '' in Network.\ '' '' '' '' Pretty stresful , but once I walked through the doors , most of that changed.\n\nSure , there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair . But , hey , it 's an emergency room . I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate . There were a couple of fails on the doctor 's part . She offered me pain meds , and then forgot to order them . I had to ask a nurse , and then they arrived quickly . Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash , but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\n \nWhen I was discharged , I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens , since I live in the neighborhood . I was referred to the hospital pharmacy , which I expected to soak me . But it only cost me $ 14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener ( yes , I said it and no , it has n't worked yet ) . Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop . If I was hospitalized , there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving . Good gift shop.\n\nI was there for approximately 4.5 hours . I had triage , xrays , and an EKG . I was admitted immediately , no waiting . I do n't have much experience with ERs , so there you go.\n\nProps to the skinny blond \ '' '' '' '' tech\ '' '' '' '' guy , who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound .

It 's always pricey to eat out , and if you want seafood you have to pay for it . If I want to run out to a family restaurant for fish and chips and a glass of iced tea , this place is fine .

17378,"`` On recommendation I dropped in for dinner . The atmosphere was very nice . An outdoor terrace was very cozy , and indoors the bar was relaxing and personal . I ordered the Guacamole on recommendation which features a Gran Marinier reduction sauce atop a chunky mound of goodness in a generous sized portion . Very nice . I ended up using it along with the rest of my order , which consisted of the Muchaca and Cheese Flautas in a red sauce . These were extra large and delicious . I enjoyed having these with the guac and probably could have stopped there , but alas I also got the steak tacos which were perfectly cooked ( seared ) chunks of marinated steak with the normal fixings and came with an interesting tomato tortilla soup which was a little too \ '' '' '' '' tomato soup\ '' '' '' '' like for me , but still was good . I paired it all with a Negro Modello that was on tap ( nice ! ) . Heradura and Patron is available to those with a few extra dollars , but that was n't for me this evening . The ingredients were all very fresh and very well prepared . I would definitely come again . ''",3,positive
36884,"`` So let 's start by putting DC Steak House into perspective relative to their price : Due to the pricing of their plates DC Steak House is competing with Flemming 's , Ruth 's Chris , Morton 's , City Hall and even The Keg . \n\nUpon entering the establishment we were warmly greeted , quickly seated and the waiter was on top of taking our drink order . However it was a bit unusual that the waiter never went over the menu , never asked if we had any questions or made any type of presentation . He simply just kept checking with us until we were prepared to tell him what we wanted . \n\nWe decided to order calamari ( as the appetizer ) two Filet Mignon 's , a loaded baked potato , steak fries and asparagus for an extra side . The calamari was slow to come out of the kitchen but was pretty good - I 've had better , I 've had a lot worse . Next up were the Filets ( which took even longer to serve ) that had a perfect grill mark presentation . Our sides appeared to be thrown on the plate and the \ '' '' '' '' loaded\ '' '' '' '' baked potato is a plain potato , still wrapped in foil , that you must finish preparing yourself . \n\nThe steak was decent tasting and they use a very high quality cut . After I made my own loaded baked potato , and removed the foil , I realized the skin was n't even salted , grilled or ... . made that appealing . Our asparagus was over salted and ... well ... I just was n't very impressed with anything thus far.\n\nAs a matter of fact - If I had tasted these steaks VS. ... .dare I say ... . Outback that Outback would come out ahead in the flavor category ( even though they do n't use a high quality cut ) and it 's 1/3 the cost . When you start comparing the other restaurants mentioned DC Steak House can not compete in any category ( Food , Service , Decor , Drinks , Bar ... ) \n\nSummary : If you want the best or need to impress then go to any other steak house mentioned in my first paragraph . If you want to eat here to say you 've experienced it - then go for it . It 's not bad . ''",2,neutral

It did n't have a ton of flavor but I did n't really mind - I just wanted something hot . The noodles seemed pretty fresh and were also really good . The udon came with 3 tempura shrimps . It was a bit heavy on the batter but it was alright when I soaked it in the soup first .

42454,"`` I have never written a review on yelp EVER before ... but this dining experience warranted one . Also I have come to expect subpar service from Asian restaurants in general ( in fact no service at all ) but I have never experienced such a horrible experience than this \ '' '' '' '' Bumming Spit Hot Shit\ '' '' '' '' . Initially , the food was decent and actually quite flavorful , besides the fact I ordered the lamb hot pot with a 5 spice level , it tasted like Kimchi . I believe they reuse the leftover soups and sauces . My significant other and I were seated quickly enough , most likely because the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty on a cold winter evening . I can now see why ... all was well until the end . Upon asking for a little to go container for the leftover dipping condiment , the lady/owner said they do not give containers for the sauces . Cilantro , spring onion , chili oil , etc costs next to nothing , yet alone the 0.02 cent container for the sauce . After the Kimchi flavor in my soup , I came to the realization they quite possibly DO reuse their soups and condiments . I was so upset to waste the leftover sauce that I poured it into the teapot and filled it with my chopstick wrapper and napkin , so they will not be able to subject other patrons to endure their leftover reuse of product . I sincerely hope this place does n't last , next time I will go all the way to Henderson to have AYCE Chinese hotpot on Silverado and Maryland . This place sucks ! They need a lesson on sanitation , service , and business . They just lost a major patron with huge retention potential ... God help this establishment !

He could have used some help at times as we were a party of 12.\n\nThis is what I would expect from your basic , yet overpriced , Vegas hotel/resort restaurant .",2,neutral
314,"Went to Elbow Room for a nice Sunday brunch experience . It was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly . My girlfriend ordered the album pancakes while I ordered the crab Eggs Benedict . Her pancakes were absolutely inedible , with such a bizarre after taste that we had to say something to the waitress . The kitchen also forgot to put any hollandaise sauce on my eggs and it looked like a 10 year old had poached them . The asparagus was raw and there were a few bits of crab , so little I thought they had forgotten that too . By the time I got any hollandaise the eggs were cold and the whole plate was ruined . When we said something about the pancakes the waitress apologized profusely and brought out some fresh French Toast , but stated that the cooks also thought something was wrong with the pancakes - - - why did she let us order them , then ? ? Makes no sense.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and very attentive , but the cooking left a lot to be desired . We wo n't be going back there for brunch anytime soon . Worst Eggs Benedict experience I 've ever had .",1,negative

29702,"What happened ? I had Ono 's at a different location and it was decent . This location ? Horrible . First off , the staff consists of ghetto high school kids with attitudes and no smiles or even a personality . The chicken , on 2 seperate occasions , was REALLY fatty . You find yourself spending most of the time picking off the fat than eating . The rice wasnt cooked correctly one visit . The flavors of some of their sauces are ok , but that wont get me to go back . Especially when Chiptole is a few doors down . And especially when its vastly overpriced . Good portions , but too bad most is inedible .",1,negative
27658,"Love this resort . It 's about as as nice a location as you can get in the Phoenix metro area . Visited the resort and had massages and manicures at the Joya spa . Wow , what a great way to spend the afternoon . If you go make sure to spend some time at the pool area the views are amazing and so relaxing .",3,positive
