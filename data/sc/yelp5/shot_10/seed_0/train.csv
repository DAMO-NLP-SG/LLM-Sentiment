"I 've never dined in , but I order late night delivery eats from here constantly . I 've recently ran out of menus to call or order by so lately I have n't been calling . Oh ... how I 've missed your pizza Cafe Verdi ! \n\nI love pizza ! But , do n't get me wrong , I am no pizza pro . However , if pizza tastes good , then so far , it 's done the job ! The taste of their pizza is just sssooo different from the franchised pizza places . It has that great soft herbal taste that goes with the pizza which makes it taste a lot lighter , and little less saltier than most pizza 's I 've tasted.\n\nI usually love to get their Cheesy Garlic bread for $ 2.99 . I mean seriously ! Who does n't love cheesy bread ! Cheesy bread brings out the daring side of a person you know ... I also get the 10 inch Hawaiian or the 10 inch BBQ chicken pizza , oh ! and the white pizza for $ 9.99 . It 's just heaven ! \n\nThey are also 24 hours , 7 days a week , including holidays , so it 's even better . If you 're just tired of the same old $ 3.99 steak and eggs after a fun night on the strip , this would be another good alternative joint , that 's anything besides breakfast .",3,positive

"I got a facial and they did not have sheets on the table . Literally there was only a blanket and a table pad . I did n't pay much attention to this until after my service when I saw the same blanket being used for a person after me . The man at the counter who is apparently Ashley 's husband was rude and was having a loud conversation about sports with another man in the spa . It is a spa setting and I just felt that it was unprofessional when I came there to relax and have a pampering day . Additionally , he quoted me the wrong price for the mani/pedi and only told me after the service when I was paying that he was mistaken about the price . I heard Ashley is great , but I had another aesthetician and she was also great for the facial . Place was clean , but I 'm giving them only 3 stars because I got a mani/ pedi and they had very limited colors . It was uncomfortable not to have a foot stool in the room they use for the mani/pedi . Man/ husband was unprofessional and it really was distasteful .",2,neutral
Great atmosphere and good value pricing ! Our new favorite on the East side of Madison . Decent wine selection at below average inflated pricing . You should try it !,4,very positive
"They were accommodating as I wanted the special baked pasta but without the meat . It was tasty , though one mushroom barely constitutes listing it as an ingredient . The meal delivery was slow in comparison to the limited number of customers . I found the prices a little steep for the quantity/quality received . I would not recommend unless you are staying in the hotel and get a discount or points .",1,negative
"We went here for the first time for my boyfriend 's birthday , and DAMN , were we all impressed.\n\nTo find such a cute , cozy restaurant in Mesa was great , but to find such a place of THIS CALIBER was just fantastic . Everything we had was amazing ( even the escargot ! ) -- the strawberry creme brulee was especially tasty . \n\nAlso , as others have mentioned , S'Bistro is BYOB , which is wonderful particularly for Mesa . If you bring a dessert , they 'll keep it in the back fridge for you . \n\nI 'm going back tonight for Christmas Even with a brand new batch of people , so I 'll have to see if everything is just as delicious and wonderful as last time .",3,positive
"Up until my last trip i was a huge southwest fan . Let me tell you what changed that . Ok i know traveling on a buddy pass is a crap shoot , but i didnt know that southwest employees treat you like garbage . I was trying to get from Mississippi where i went and saw my sons college football game on saturday ( 9/22/12 ) . Getting there was ok , getting home on Sunday was a true nightmare . I flew from Mississippi to Chicago with no problems . Once in Chicago the nightmare started . The first flight to Phoenix was at 12:05pm Chicago time . I was bumped from that flight and every flight th erest of the day , a total of 8 flights i was bumped from . I was told by a southwest employee at the gate ( Kristen ) that the lesson learned was that i shouldnt be so cheap and next time buy a regular ticket . ( wow ) . \nSo stuck in Chicago there was a flight at 830pm to las Vegas , which i did get the last seat on . Once to vegas there were no more flights to phoenix and the gate agent stated that i had used all my passes up with that flight to Vegas , so basically i was stuck in the airport over night . I sleep on the floor and was told that someone would be in at 4am and to check with them if i could catch a flightto Phoenix . So as i layed on the floor over night i thought about what Kristie had said to not be cheap and buya ticket , so to me southwest treats customers like trash . O before i forget i also jst tried to purchase a ticket from Chicago to Phoenix and was told i couldnt do so because i started my travels on a buddy pass and i had to end my travel with a buddy pass..I will never use southwest again PERIOD ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .Worst Airline experience in my Life..",0,very negative
"The d stands for dump . Though this hotel advertises its newly remodeled room this place is still old and falling apart . The remodel consists of a few cosmetic cover-ups , dancing girls showing some skin , and loud music . The bathtub felt like you would fall to the floor below when you stand in the wrong spot and was chipping off all over . The drawer on our dressor would n't closed and was propped up by a piece of paper . Sadly , our room was the upgraded premium corner king . The view was probably the only saving grace . The elevators are supposed to be an upgrade but they are TERRIBLE ! So slow and confusing for many . Overall , a dump with a fancy paint job",0,very negative

"`` Do you guys ever watch \ '' '' '' '' How I Met Your Mother ? \ '' '' '' '' In one episode , Barney tells Ted , \ '' '' '' '' new is always better.\ '' '' '' '' This phrase seems to ring truest in a place like Vegas where new attractions , hotels , restaurants & shopping malls are constantly popping up . Still , I am a huge fan of decade-old Mandalay Bay & all it has to offer . For me , new is not always better ( in most cases , anyways ... . ) \n\n $ 18 gets you a pretty short self-guided tour ( 30-35 minutes ) of awesome marine life . Crocs , turtles , a kimodo dragon , unfortunate-looking fish , florescent-colored fish , a tunnel where you are surrounded by sharks & a shallow pool where you can \ '' '' '' '' pet\ '' '' '' '' stingrays & horseshoe crab ( a few were engaged in a mating ritual when we went ) ... it 's all something we 've seen before , but still a beautiful , four-star worthy attraction .

"Went to this place with my kids cause we thought it looked cool , tried it . It was horrible . Tacos look like dog meat or some sorta dog food , not carne asada , and the chicken in my torta was some sort of canned chicken , almost mistaked it for tuna cause of the almost similar smell and texture . I 'm really big at eating/shopping at small and local business and restaurants cause that 's where you always get the good stuff , but got ta tell yeah I was really disappointed when I came to this place . 16 bucks for 3 tacos that went in the trash and a torta along with a mediocre hot dog and drinks . Never coming back here again . My fingers still smell like the meat in the torta .",0,very negative
"The Margaritas are the BEST ! ! ! However they are a bit expensivo but let me tell you how you fix this problem . Have at least three because after the 2nd you wont give a damn how much they cost cuz your buzz will have you as happy as a hippo.\nAs for the food at this Javier 's , well it 's not all that . Yes the food is good but since its Vegas you can defiantly find a better dinning experience elsewhere . Stick to the drinks , hold up the bar and enjoy the eye candy the Aria hotel has to offer . Hopefully the bartenders are more friendly and attentive because they were slow when I visited this Javier 's . \nEnjoy the margaritas and Hasta La Vista Baby .",2,neutral
"Surprisingly , not so good . The wait staff is a little on the snooty side . I had a filet mignon that was sitting on about a teaspoon of spinach and a few dried tomatoes , with a bit of shaved truffle on top . Sounds great , but it turned out to be a very dry steak and it was overcooked too . For a $ 59 steak , I expected it to at least be cooked correctly . My dining companion ordered the same , and his was under-cooked . I would n't go back there . For a great meal , I recommend heading to Red Square at Mandalay Bay . Red Square 's steak is terrific , and everything else on their menu is fabulous too . Do n't waste your time at The Country Club at Wynn .",1,negative
"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning . The brunch is a buffet , so bring your appetite . There are different stations for custom eggs/omelets , meats , soup , desserts , seafood , cheese , fruits , etc . Unfortunately the buffet area is in a small area , so it gets pretty cramped when you are getting your food . Waiting in line for food is something that makes me quite uncomfortable and medieval.\n\nThe tapas menu is probably the best thing about the brunch , as they will bring you small dishes of breakfast and seafood options.\n\nIn terms of quality , the prepared food , like the tapas and omelet station are quite good . Aside from that , the mass prepared food is pretty average . The breads and dessert are below average , since they are both dry and flavorless . I think I would have been satisfied if the whole meal for two was less than $ 30 , but sadly it was about double the price.\n\nFor the value , I do not think I would return for the brunch .",2,neutral
Incredible concept and awesome food . I hit this place everytime I 'm in Phoenix . The service is attentive and friendly . I 'll be back soon .,4,very positive
When I come to Vegas I always come here its so good ... I love the look of the place its very trendy and sexy and has a good vibe.. The wait staff knows what they are doing and can always recommend things.. The food is very good and fresh and they have a huge Saki Menu ... I recommend ordering a bunch of little things and sharing that 's what we usually do..,4,very positive
"I try to go this place every couple of trips to Vegas ( because there are so many restaurants in Vegas ) . I 've been with and without a band . I prefer no band , do n't get me wrong I love live music , but this place is way to small and intimate . I like the subtlety of Irish music in the background , not so loud that you ca n't talk . I usually have the halibut , which is AMAZING ! the food is slightly pricey , if you do n't have time to eat , at least stop in and have a beer or cocktail . Beautiful place ! Fish and chips are also yummy !",3,positive
"The hotel is pretty nice , but the location is terrible . It 's close enough to Phoenix , but it is nearly impossible to get to Phoenix , since the roads are divided by medians that require you to drive pretty far to turn around and then to drive further the opposite direction to make a u-turn to the interstate . The section of the road that our hotel was on was completely closed for construction ( on a Sunday ! ! ) on the third day of our stay . The hotel never bothered to warn us or give us the alternative way to enter the hotel , which was through the back parking lot of a large office building . I also had to ask for room service more than once .",2,neutral
"EPIC FAIL ! \n\nWow , what a complete disappointment ! HORRIBLE service ! \n\nWe ( 2 of us ) went in a little after noon on a Sunday for lunch . It was my first time trying a Wing Stop and I was super disappointed . The store hours say they open at 11am , but when we walked in after noon they were still setting things up and took several minutes to come to the counter to greet us . They were nice enough , but it took over 20 minutes to get our food.\n\nOver 20 minutes for hot wings is ridiculous . Then to add insult to injury one of the two orders of fries was so over salted it was inedible . They replaced the fries without any hassle , but all the fries were not cooked the same . They were cut all oddball with some skinny and some thick , so some were overcooked and some undercooked.\n\nThe wings were decent , but nothing impressive . I have had better at several other wing places . There are too many places that make good wings and have good service to ever go here again.\n\nI have a hunch the reason for the bad service was no management . I did n't see any manager in the store . Everyone looked college age and while it is certainly possible a college age person could be a manager , nobody in that store acted like one . \n\nSteer clear if you want good food with good service .",0,very negative
"This is a poor apolgy for an ISP . They first wanted my SS number to run credit . When I told them that I would rather give them a deposit than have them run credit , they first refused . Then after lots of back and forth , they charged my Amex for $ 100 for equipment deposit and set up an install date . This morning someone calls me and said they need the SS number after all and since I didnt provide it , they have arbitarirly cancelled my appointment and needed me to reschedule . I offered to show them my ATT & T , Verizon and Dish bills to show that I have been a customer and never been late , but this woman did not want to hear it . Kept insiting that I fax them a copy of my SS card . Can these people be really that retarded ? I asked for a copy of the receipt to show the $ 100 charge to my Amex . The operator and a supervisor said it could not be done . \n\nI finally told them to cancel the order and refund my money . Surprise , surprise , they wanted my money immediately but it takes them 10-12 days to refund my money via a paper check . \n\nDont know anything about how good or bad their service is , but if their customer service is any indiaction , I have no intention of finding out . I am running the other way , Gangnam style .",0,very negative

"I finally stopped in True Food Kitchen for a quick bite to eat with 2 kids . I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole ( I love spaghetti squash ) and the kids ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and ravioli . I really liked my spaghetti squash - just right portion size and very tasty . The kids teriyaki bowl with quinoa was excellent ! ! The ravioli was a bit small portion-wise , and was n't as appealing as the teriyaki , but still good.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly - which we appreciated since we were on a tight schedule . We were here at 4pm though , so there was hardly anyone in the restaurant . Nice atmosphere , and the patio was lovely ( although we did n't sit out there because it was August ) . The bill was $ 30 , which seems a bit steep considering I did n't have anything but water . I guess that 's what you pay in Scottsdale Quarter for fresh , organic food though . Still , it just seems a bit overpriced .",3,positive

"`` AYCE Sushi , AYCT Service ( All You Can Tolerate ) \n\nA lot of the sashimi I ordered was chewy , which is a horrible adjective to use for raw fish . The usual mayonaisse bathed , over-riced rolls were present too , but what makes this place go from average to sub-par is the service.\n\nOur waitress looked very irritated each time she came by our table . She dropped off our food at the table next to us , and then attempted to bring it to us after the diners had been poking at it in confusion . Items were forgotten and never brought out , and no apologies were ever offered . \n\nMy biggest issue here is that it says all over the menu , \ '' '' '' '' We charge for leftover food , including rice , 45 minute time limit.\ '' '' '' '' If you 're going to impose strict eating guidelines on your customers , at least present them with a pleasant experience and decent food . \n\nThere are many AYCE places in town , I would n't return to this one .

"Lunch buffet , $ 12.95 ( no drink ) . Water refills were frequent , but other than that service was terrible . We came in , waited . Finally , a man approached . He did not speak a word . He showed us to a table , and walked away . after waiting a few minutes we decided no one was coming back and headed for the buffet . The restaurant itself is in need of a scrub down and a spruce up . \n\nThe buffet itself was mostly mediocre . Several items I tried were pretty bad . The fried items were soggy . Most dishes were tasteless , and there was not much selection for a vegetarian.\n\nBUT there was one dish that was out of this world good . Mater Paneer , or green peas and paneer . I am almost crying thinking about it ( NO JOKE ) . It was awesome . One of the best things I 've ever eaten . I could eat this dish for EVERY MEAL EVERY DAY fFOR THE REST OF MY LIFE .

"Stopped in here for a late lunch and had a very indifferent meal . We sat out on the patio overlooking the Wynn Golf Club which was unfortunately closed for maintenance , so we could n't watch the golfers . We did n't want to order too much , as we had a dinner reservation for later in the day at one of our favourite Las Vegas restaurants ( B & B ) .\n\nI had the caesar salad with shrimp , and my wife ordered the cobb salad with lump crab meat . While my salad was a very nice portion , with great caesar dressing and terrific parmesan crisps , the cobb salad set in front of my wife was simply huge ! Especially after asking the waiter if the salad would be too big , we were both surprised by the size of the bowl on the table , and more surprising was that the lump crab meat was not good . It seemed to be very old and without flavour . The other ingredients were very good , but overall it was not a winning dish.\n\nThe Country Club is a great location , but they only scored on one of the two dishes they served us .",1,negative
"Cute froyo place , not self-serve but set up more like a Pinkberry where the staff get your yogurt and toppings for you . Pricing was pretty low , but the mini size is the best size for a single person.\n\nFlavors have good variety , about ten total , with some seasonal additions- most recently tried the pumpkin pie and the coffee , preferring the first . Both were a bit drippy and melty when they were being dispensed , and the coffee flavor was oddly flavorless.\n\nService is friendly , pricing is low , and they have a text club you can join for discounts . Daily schedule of discounts and specials is posted on their door .",2,neutral

"This is a hidden gem of Vegas . From the looks of the entrance , you 'd never guess that this place is a full fledged restaurant .

Gorgeous murals abound . The waitstaff was top-notch and the food was outstanding . Do n't let this place pass you by . This was our best dinner in Vegas .",4,very positive

We also ordered a burrito that was not included in the bag that we did not discover until we got home , very disappointing experience .",1,negative
