"Carla and I have eaten here several times , and we 're always pleased . Their falafel wrap is wonderful - a definite must have .

"`` When I walked in here at 10:00 a.m. today , I was hoping to see an assortment of scrumptious bread products ( perhaps of the breakfast variety , given the time of day ) and attentive friendly staff . Instead , the first things I encountered were a closed register to my right , a tower of products for sale to my left , and a short line of patrons ahead of me . \n\nI scanned the menu overhead . Nothing offered for breakfast jumped out at me as particularly exciting . There were several staff members behind the counter , some bustling about , others not so much . For the four minutes I stood in that unmoving line , not once did any member of the horde of visible employees greet me , smile at me , or even freaking look at me . This made me unhappy -- hey , Kneaders , let me know you appreciate my business ! \n\nAs I continued to stand there like the ghost I apparently was , things started to agitate me , like the location of the merchandise mountain blocking the dining area from view and the fact that the bread behind the counter was haphazardly thrown onto wooden shelves ( I assume this was the look they were going for , though ) . I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items . It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu ( \ '' '' '' '' till 11 a.m.\ '' '' '' '' ) . Why were n't breakfast items showcased ? Maybe hip Arizonans eat frosted brownies for breakfast and I 'm out of touch.\n\nI wish I could comment on the taste of the food , the speed & accuracy of service , portion sizes and what not . Unfortunately , I departed after those four uneventful minutes . This first impression of Kneaders is a crappy one and I do n't plan on giving a second chance any time soon . Great job rubbing a bread lover the wrong way ! ''",0,very negative

Second time i ordered Chicago style pizza thought i would give them a fair chance.\nI lived in Cicago for 35 years i love Chicago pizza THEIRS IS NO CHICAGO PIZZA.\nI do n't know about the rest of the menu but you will be disappointed if you know pizza and expect a real Chicago experience . The dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough . \nSo stay away from ordering Chicago Style unless you have money to waste,1,negative
"I 've been here twice . It seems both times , they had the same items in the buffet . Service was poor - none of the wait staff say anything to you until you pay the bill . We were seated by the window and a neon sign that was making a loud noise and smelled like it was burning or going to catch fire . The food was ok - the samosas were subpar , Maharaja on the West side seems to have the best tasting food and the most options for vegans/vegetarians .",1,negative

"We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from Raymond Vineyards designed especially for Morton 's called primal cut and it was boldly delicious and perfect for the steaks we ordered.\n\nSuperb aged four weeks steaks ! My husband had the porterhouse and I had the NY strip both perfectly prepared medium rare ! We ordered a side of mushrooms in au jus and they accompanied the steaks nicely.\n\nBefore the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top . We also shared the Morton 's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies . All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared ! \n\nMy husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks . It was divinely chocalatey ! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal .

Plus , they had $ 6 wines.\nThe salmon salad was fantastic and the portions were all very large , especially the burgers and the club sandwich.\nObviously , it was not the restaurant 's fault that they were busy ( a very good thing ) and they took the necessary actions to make it up to us.\nVery good restaurant all around .

"In a single word , Awesomeness ... . For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants , there 's really nothing that can compare to Mastros . There 's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club . \n\nMy last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week . That did n't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations . When you walk into Ocean Club , there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale . \n\nI was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple . We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room . The service was impeccable . We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server . We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends . \n\nMy friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this . Dare I say , we 're pretty predictable ... . for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100 % orders bone-in filet . We were in luck , they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should . Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.\n\nSo , the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative . I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes , so very yummy and succulent and filling . Not something I would order , but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table ! The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty . My friend loves the creamed corn . My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach . \n\nFor dessert , my friend loves Mastro 's butter cake and we never go there without having it . Again , very tasty and delicious.\n\nThis is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent 's wedding anniversary , a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with . This place is fantastic . It is truly as good as it gets . I 'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro 's Steakhouse . I 'm totally biased , this is the best restaurant chain on the planet . Period .",4,very positive

"Been here a few times because our kids enjoy ribs and do n't complain when we say we will go Lucille 's ! We went this week and asked for Kris as our server since she helped us the last time and was so patient and friendly with our 3 kids . This time was no different than the last time , she was super friendly and attentive . We usually get ribs and a pasta dish but this time we just ordered 2 racks of ribs with mac n cheese , veges , and corn on the cobb . Ribs and Mac n Cheese were excellent . I did n't try the other sides but my husband said they were good . We ordered an appetizer that is n't on the menu , its the potato chips but we have them make them like nachos , they are so yummy ! Do your self a favor and ask them for that next time you go in . Overall a great family place to eat and huge selection of things to pic from .",4,very positive
"I wish I could give this a 3.5 ! It 's a wonderful place for a quick lunch - but this is not a place I would frequent for dinner due to atmosphere and menu choices , hence the lower rating . If you 're a fan of the walk up and order establishments , this would be a prime contender . Now for the food ! I 'm not a huge fan of their pizzas . They taste great with gourmet ingredients - thin crust , but there are so many other pizza joints I would suggest first . What I do love and highly suggest are their salads . I think my favorite would have to be the caprese , which is actually a standard salad with lettuce , pieces of tomato and fresh mozzarella mixed in , an amazing balsamic vinaigrette , and to top it off ... lightly crunchy buttered/oiled croutons made from their fresh bread . \n\nMy second choice salad is the chicken/gorgonzola/tomato/pine nut one . Fresh light dressing makes this a summer time delight . \n\nTheir bruschetta is also great , but expect them to be small in portion , very individual , not shareable as an appetizer really . Great flavors ! \n\nPaninis and pasta also are a large portion of the menu , but alas , I have not tried any of these yet ! \n\nIn all , a great place to grab a quick bite with good food aimed to please . If you 're familiar with restaurants like Noodles n Co or Cosi , this is right in line . Not quite what I expected from a FOX creation , but yummy.\n\np.s . their triple chocolate cookies ( plain cookie dough , dark , milk , white chips ) are way worth $ 1 more . Make sure to take advantage of them because I am addicted even though I do n't really love chocolate !",3,positive

"`` I have never written a review before , but after a restaurant experience like this one , I felt as though it was necessary . Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait . Honestly , we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place . Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant . We were seated right away , but did n't receive our actual meals until an hour later . We received our appetizers fairly quickly , but 30 minutes went by after that and we had n't heard anything about where our food was . Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone 's plate but ours . Our server then told us that they were backed up . It was n't that busy in there at the time , and it sure did n't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners . We even saw people sit down after us , finish their meals , and leave ! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long , and he said they were just busy . We waited , and waited . The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place , so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it 's been 40 minutes since our appetizers . He preceded to argue with us and say \ '' '' '' '' I know when I sat you , and I sat you 20 minutes ago ! \ '' '' '' '' I 've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us . How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I 'll never know.\n\n The management was just terrible . That is $ 15 I 'll never spend on a meal there again . We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks . Hopefully they 'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists . Oh , and their bread was extremely hard and cold . Awful experience . ''",0,very negative
"`` I was very excited to try this place after seeing the reviews on here . We waited for about 30 minutes for our table , which is n't too bad in general , but upon being seated I figured out what the break in the chain is : the kitchen . \n\nOur waiter , Luke , was competent and friendly . As we waited for food , I could n't help but notice large gatherings of servers standing at the food \ '' '' '' '' window\ '' '' '' '' waiting for the seemingly missing dishes from their orders . Plates would appear one at a time , which was odd since the average table size was 4+ . It became obvious that food tickets were n't being completed a ticket at a time , instead , they were batching meals . \n\nOur appetizer , chocolate covered bacon , came out just before our meals started to be delivered ... which took about 20 minutes after ordering . One side of pancakes ( regular ) were delivered . Then , a few minutes later , the second and third side of pancakes ( pumpkin cheesecake ) . Then , yet another few minutes later , the french toast entree arrived . It took almost 10 minutes for the omelets to come out . One side of pancakes never came out , so we got them to go . \n\nThe food was very good ! The kitchen manager was seen speaking very \ '' '' '' '' animated\ '' '' '' '' to the waiters and line cooks , which was unprofessional and , from what I could tell , he was the weak link ( in the white shirt on the left facing away in the picture ) . Ticket times were all over the place , and orders were not being delivered all-at-once . \n\nThe restaurant has been around for 5 weeks , so they should be over growing pains like this . We will be back for the food , though.\n\nFor those complaining about the noise : I feel you . No carpet , no cushions , all hard surfaces ! \n\nThey take reservations , which is good ! ''",2,neutral

The ceviche is also great and the vampiro brings a little class to the standard street taco . \n\nPeople may complain about the diminutive menu but I say there is no need to when you do those few things well .

"I love kitchen stores , and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh . Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware . None of them are really any good for any of us .

My review has a lot to do with my past experience and how far I believe they 've fallen off.\n\nI lived in Ballantyne for about five years , but moved closer to center city about six years ago . While I lived in south Charlotte , this was one of my favorite places to frequent . Huge plates , tons of fresh veggies , everything cooked great.\n\nWell , after visiting this past weekend - boy things have really fallen off . To be completely fair it is relatively on a par with most other Mexican restaurants . But I do n't pay $ 18 for a plate at any other Mexican place , and if I did I would want it to be better than Zapata 's turned out . I opted for the steak , shrimp and veggies ( okay , I admit that is n't a typical meal at a Mexican restaurant ) . Steak was waaay overcooked , as were the shrimp . The veggies were good , just not as many as I had come to expect . All in all the meal was just \ '' '' '' '' eh\ '' '' '' '' .\n\nA big point of frustration for my fiance came when she ordered drinks for our group : two girls and two guys . When the drinks were brought to us , there were two large glasses ( given to the guys ) and two small glasses ( given to girls ) .

"`` I went to My Mother 's for dinner with a large group of family members ( 16 ) , including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old . While the decor was generically bad \ '' '' '' '' down-home\ '' '' '' '' from the 80 's , the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.\n\nThe meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft . This gave me hope that the meal would n't be in keeping with the general feel of the place . Alas , my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.\n\nAfter ordering , I made my way to the salad bar . This seemed quaint , considering that salad bars are n't really popular anymore , unless you 're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes . The salad bar was not entirely scary , but was n't anything worth going back to . I 'm fairly certain everything came out of a can , bag , bottle or box . The freshest thing may have been the red onion , which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.\n\nMoving on to the main course , I had Mother 's Meat Loaf dinner . My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans . Once again , food from cans and boxes made an appearance , as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix . The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat , but was n't all that exciting . It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top , yet was served with gravy on the side ( probably originally made from a powder mix ) . I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry , not because of the quality.\n\nHoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state , I ordered pie for dessert . They tout their homemade pies , but seem to think that \ '' '' '' '' homemade\ '' '' '' '' means making pie from canned ingredients . My cherry pie was not spectacular , as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light , flaky and buttery , but only managed to be dry and chewy.\n\nMy Mother 's was saved from a one-star rating by two things ... the graciousness and patience of the staff , and the low prices . For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I , our total bill including tax and tip was $ 35.\n\nMy advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother 's Restaurant .

The correct address is 20020 N. 59TH AVE .\n\nI note this place is very new and still working things out and has potential so it 's worth a try.\n\nWe tried several things here and I think some things are better than others.\n\nFrom what I tried on my visit I think the Beef Asada and the Chile Verde are much better than the fish here . The meats were flavorful but terribly dry when we were here . The fish from the fish tacos might have been a frozen product that had little flavor and it was kind of dry for fish.\n\nThey have a selection of house made sauces and a few condiments to add to your dish.\n\nCustomer service is not the best.\n\nI ordered a side of Hot Carrots ( .99 cents ) before I noticed they are a free condiment . They should have told me it was on the sauce bar . But it made me a little more mad when the woman working there runs me an empty cup and tells me to fill it up myself from the freebie bar .

The best one in the area though ( There 's only 2 ) \n\nReally have n't had a chance to explore more than just a few staple dishes yet though . What I have tried was fairly good though.\n\nThe place was clean and the service was fast helping give them a rock solid 3 stars .,2,neutral
"One of the best places for dinner on the strip ! My friends and I ate dinner on the Patio . The view of the strip as well as the Bellagio 's Fountains in the background was great . As for price , it ran us about $ 350.00 for 5 people to have a full 3 course dinner with wine . We had not seen each other so we spent well over two hours talking and socializing during our dinner . This was one of the best evenings we all spent together in Las Vegas . It is a lot of food , but take your time and have the soup , main course , and desert . Desert is hard to order when your full , but it is absolutely amazing here ! \n\nThe wait staff did a great job taking care of us . We were never once interrupted and even with a busy place they took their time with us explaining everything as well as giving us the felling there was no hurry take your time . The most amazing thing , was that we thought our waitress did such a good job we tipped her very well . She came running after us to make sure that we understood that we had given a large trip . After we explained that yes we did that intentionally she thanked us and wished us a good night .",4,very positive
"I called every location Super pawn in Las Vegas to see if they had any IPhones.. I was so happy because the representative I spoke to said they had a iPhone 4S . It was exactly what I wanted and it was AT & T phone that I wanted as well ! So I was extremely happy ! She asked for my name and said she 'd hold it till the next morning , I gave her my name and number and said I 'd come in asap and that I would n't even wait till the next day . I drive 20mins out there go in the store with the biggest smile for them to tell me Awe I 'm sorry ma'am we literally just SOLD it ! ! ! ! I was just so irritated at the fact that she said she 'd hold it and that I said I was coming to the store that same day I spoke to her ! !",0,very negative
