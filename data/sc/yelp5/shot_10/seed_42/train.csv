"I have a very hard time believeing this place warrants all of the high praise . Maby the dining in experience is better . My review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did . The burritos were poorly labled and was difficult to tell which ones did not have nasty chorizo in them . The burrito I had a bite of and spat out was a salty , greasy mess . Of course I picked a burrito with chorizo . So glad I did not waste any calories on this .",0,very negative
"`` Hello there ! \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My name is Naiby Moreno , and the reason why I 'm writing you this email is because last night , around this time , I was at your location in 4409 E. McKellips Rd , Mesa AZ , 85215 , and I placed an order for a few drinks where my bill came up to a little over $ 20.00 , unfortunately , I lost my receipt so , it 's hard for me to give you the accurate information , however , I asked the cashier who took my order and realized later that it was the Store Mgr , if I could get my drinks in your reusable plastic cups , to what she said , \ '' '' '' '' No problem , \ '' '' '' '' \ '' '' '' '' it will be $ 1.00 each , \ '' '' '' '' so , I said , \ '' '' '' '' Yes , that 's fine\ '' '' '' '' . Since I ordered some frappuccinos , the barista gave me some dome lids and told me , that they were giving me those covers because of the whipped cream , and he also said , but we 'll give you the plastic lids on the side , we are just looking for them , so , I said , perfect ! , my kids and I sat down , and started drinking our drinks , waiting also to get our plastic covers , about 10 minutes had passed by , and I saw the two baristas and the mgr , talking and brewing coffee , but nobody looking for any lids , so I went to the register and ordered an extra item which was a double chocolate chip brownie , so , the same blonde girl who was the \ '' '' '' '' MGR\ '' '' '' '' , took my order again , and I asked her if they had my lids for my cups , because we did need them , so , she gave me a sarcastic look and said , \ '' '' '' '' Oh , I am looking for them\ '' '' '' '' , so , I said , ok , thanks . I went back to my chair and sat down again , and waited , and waited and waited , another 10 to 15 minutes had passed by , so , finally she came out and told us that they did n't have any lids for the cups , but that she was calling some stores to see if they could borrow some from them , so , I said , ok , by this time , I was already getting upset about the fact that she was almost ignoring me , because she did n't even say \ '' '' '' '' SORRY\ '' '' '' '' , and it just seemed that she did n't care , \u00a0 and still I was trying to be nice and asked her if there was any other store around to where she could call and ask to give them to me , if it was on my way home , to what she replied , \ '' '' '' '' I am calling them\ '' '' '' '' , so , again , she went back inside , and again , I waited another 5 minutes , finally she came back again holding one plastic lid and laughing she said , \ '' '' '' '' So , I only have one lid for your cups , but I there is this other store at McDowell and Power , and they have the other lids for you , you just have to go and get them\ '' '' '' '' . Really ? ? ? , is that how you suppose to fix your problems , now , that and her careless attitude pissed me off , so , right after she said that to me I replied with a \ '' '' '' '' and you are the mgr , \ '' '' '' '' and she said yes , and I said , \ '' '' '' '' and you 're sorry ? , because you never said sorry\ '' '' '' '' , so we started arguing when she said \ '' '' '' '' yes I did\ '' '' '' '' , and I said \ '' '' '' '' No you didn't\ '' '' '' '' . After this , I said , in my receipt says that I can get a refund if I do n't want the items , and she said , fine I will give you a refund . I mentioned to her that I was a mgr at a coffee shop as well , and I knew about customer service standards , and I told her that what she was doing was n't the right way of fixing a problem , to what she did n't like , I told her , \ '' '' '' '' you as a Mgr , should know better that if you are out of plastic lids for your cups , you should n't even be selling them , or at least you need to let the customer know about the inconvenience . I asked my kids to finish their drinks because we were returning the cups that I had just purchased for them , because they had no lids for them , thus , we were not going to be able to use them to carry hot coffee , I went back to the register and gave your Mgr the cups that she threw away in the trash can in front of me , splashing milk everywhere around , then she asked me if I was keeping the one cup with the lid , and I said well , yes , my other daughter went home already , so , I ca n't returned that one , so , after going back in the transaction in the system and refunded me for 4 cups , she stated that my total was $ 4.08 then she said , my bad your total is actually less because I gave you \u00a2.10 off each drink , again I said , ok , that was a discount on THE DRINKS not on the cups , and she argued again and said yes , but thats how the system works , so , honestly and at that point I did n't care anymore of what she was doing or saying , I just told her WHATEVER , just give me my money back , I just want to leave this place , so she did , then she made me sign a refund ticket , to proof the transaction , so I signed , and when I was leaving the location , I reminded her , to remove the cups from the display or to at least let her customer know about the inconvenience.\n\u00a0I am sorry , if I made this look like such a big deal , but coming from the management of food industry , I know my rights as a customer and I expect respect and good service , why , because I am paying for my product , I never asked for anything free , just some good service , obviously my question is : What kind of service are your crew members suppose to give , when the Mgr acts that way they wo n't care , right ? , ''",0,very negative

"Impressive - yes.\nTasty - not as good as you would think.\n\nWith all that said , this is still my type of place to get a quick bite , late night bite ( open until midnight ) , or indulge in a pastry.\n\nSmall juices - $ 4.95 \n\nChocolate croissant $ 4 - mammoth in size , thick crust and thick throughout , which means it wo n't be an airy soft croissant , EXTREMELY salty . In fact , that 's all that I could taste . This truly tasted like salty bread in the form of a brick-like croissant.\n\nTandoori chicken sandwich - good but bland and heavy , I did n't understand the need for cheese in this sandwich.\n\nSundried Tomato Chicken Sandwich - this was the better of the 2 sandwiches and had more flavor ( barely ) .\n\nAll sandwiches are : \n*roughly $ 9 to $ 10\n*all come with cheese \n*all are pre-made which means that they do not make to order if you have special requests ( what you see is what you get ) \n*can be slightly toasted or pressed , which makes it super greasy ( so if you want to feel less guilty , maybe eat it as is aka cold ) \n*filling for 1 person\n*overall - bland sandwiches \n\nCoconut Macaroons - \nIndividual wrapped : $ 2 for the plain or $ 3 for the chocolate half iced \n4 pack - $ 8 \nThese are dense and moist mothers . The coconut flavor is mild . Halfway through , I almost forgot I was eating a macaroon because it is so moist , it has the texture and consistency of a brownie or a cake pop.\n\nPalmiers $ 14 - waiting to be opened but I have a feeling that these will be as salty as their croissants\n\nCaramel Corn - $ 9.80 waiting to be opened\n\nChocolates - $ 6 for 2 pieces waiting to be opened \n\nOverall , you are definitely paying for the brand . They place a lot of attention to every detail , which I can appreciate - down to their plastic ware - which looks like real silverware . heh . \n\nLocation : in Aria \n\nParking : free self-park structure",2,neutral
"`` Visited this place in March when vacation in Las Vegas ! Wow what a surprise ? I was a little concerned when the hainan chicken is only priced at $ 4.95 ! What can they offer you for this price ? Everything is at least double the price here in San Francisco ! And they even have choice of white meat , dark meat with & without bones . I struggled a bit & still decide to order the hainan chicken . My husband ordered curry ! We were both surprised & satisfied ! The hainan chicken 's \ '' '' '' '' rice\ '' '' '' '' is really good & yummy too ! The meal portion is big . Never expected , and price & taste way exceed our expectation !

I do n't know if it was the cashier ( s ) or the customers but after waiting 15 minutes in line and only moved a couple steps we decided the wait was n't worth it . We were n't the only people to decide we were n't going to wait , 2 other couples ended up walking away before us and then shortly after we left . It was obvious there was a line , it was obvious people were leaving because the wait was too long , and not once none of the employees said anything , did n't step up to help with the line , nothing ! ! Joes could have yummy Italian ice , but I would n't know since I could n't order , not in 15 minutes anyways . Who knows when I 'll try it or if I even will .",0,very negative

"`` High on Attitude ... Low on Service..\n\nBy this point , I would have imagined Postino would running better then a Patek Philippe watch ... .That was not the case last night . \n\nMy suggestion ...

I was hoping the new \ '' '' '' '' central\ '' '' '' '' location would be \ '' '' '' '' inspired\ '' '' '' '' by Postino ... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring ! We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which , a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group , so why did it seem so chaotic ? \n\nWe found some seats at the bar and waited to be served ... and waited ... and waited ... we counted 3-4 on bar staff ... yet the \ '' '' '' '' main'\ '' '' '' '' bartender seemed pre-occupied , and easily distracted.. AHAD ? We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders . \n\n As we looked around , we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all . ( Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant , however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service ) \n\nThere was one lucky group at the bar , ( We think they were the original cast from the movie Sixteen Candles ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times , maintaining the bartender 's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered . Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff ... Hey ... whatever it takes ... I guess I 'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit ! \n\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great , the same quality as the Campbell location . Warm , thickly sliced artisan bread , covered with generous amounts of toppings . Our favorites were the prosciutto , Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy ! ! ! The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star . \n\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed our food ... we stayed . Big mistake ! We foolishly thought once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken , that was not the case ... the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first ! \n\nIf I were the owner , .. I 'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker , service focused and had more personality then anyone at the bar..\n\nI look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \ '' '' '' '' ironed out\ '' '' '' '' the \ '' '' '' '' kinks\ '' '' '' '' ..

"Pretty disappointed with my last visit . \n\nWent for lunch on a Tuesday with my boyfriend and his daughter around 1:30 , it was pretty dead , only about 4 other seated tables . We were seated quickly , waited for about 10 minutes for a server and no one came . We eventually had to go up to the bar to ask for someone to take out order . The bartender was very apologetic , friendly and took our order quickly . I ordered the BBQ chicken salad , BF got a bacon cheddar burger and the little one got a cheese burger off the kids menu . \n\nSalad was very tasty with good portions and lot of different ingredients for a nice variety of flavor . BFs burger was bland , and they forgot his onion strings . It was a couple dollars extra for the burger meal to be upgraded with sweet potato fries . They were decent , all 15 of them . The kids meal burger was incredible tasteless with a stale bun . She took 3 bites and refused to eat the rest . \n\nAll in all , we will not come back . We were offered a free desert for the lack of service , which was good and a nice gesture , which warrants 2 stars .",1,negative

"Perhaps a victim of bad timing just after a trip home to California , the popular taqueria / bar has the interior and service that is buzzworthy , but the food fell flat for me . \nLet 's start with the name - Bakersfield . In the 70s & 80s it and Fresno vied for the unenviable title of the armpit of California . Perhaps it 's had a big renaissance and is a hip unknown treasure unbeknownst to me , but even my friends from Central Valley chuckled that we had a restaurant named Bakersfield and thought maybe it was a bad omen . \n\nThe exterior is super hip with the wood-slat awnings , garage door windows and lack of tacky signage . The interior has a warm cozy feel with lots of unfinished reclaimed wood , Edison bulbs hanging everywhere and a busy stream of patrons . They really nailed the feel of the place and I hope they stay for a long while in this seemingly cursed spot . Finding parking is not easy when the Valet lot and street parking is full , so hopefully they might strike a deal with another local business to borrow space after hours . \n\nThe service is impeccable - very very fast food delivery and attentive service . If you wish , you could get in and out for dinner in 30-40 minutes if you do n't have to wait for a table and you 're not drinking cerveza out of their adorable boot shaped glasses . \n\nBut the menu ... ugh . First , I 've never been to a taqueria that did n't give free chips . C'mon folks . Jack up the cost of each taco by 1 buck and give us free chips already . The prices are reasonable , so just build it in . Second , if you do n't want a taco , you are really limited to tostada or 2 different tortas . The sides are also quite limited . We did have the corn chowder which really sticks to the ribs- perhaps the cheesiest , thickest chowder I 've ever had . It is fantastic with their chipotle salsa on top . \n\nFor the main attraction , los tacos , they have 8 ( ish ) different choices- two different chickens ( mole & cider braised ) , pastor ( pork & pineapple ) , two different vegetarian choices , a fish ( mahi ) and braised short rib . My choices were really limited because I 'm allergic to cilantro , so I had the mole with pickled onions and mahi without the slaw . Hubs had mahi , braised short rib , other chicken and pork . The tortilla are house made . Honestly , none of the tacos sang for us . The short rib was particularly dry , the mole was more acidic than smooth mole-ish like you want it to be , the cider braise was way vinegary , and the pork was fine . The mahi was the top choice for both of us , though only comes with one fish finger in the middle , so do n't expect to fill up on 2 . Honestly , Pinky 's & Cabo Fish Taco have better more filling choices . \n \nI saved my rant for the end , so feel free to tune out now . [ Steps on soapbox ] As I said , maybe it was just because two weeks ago I was in the SF Bay Area and had 2 stellar flavorful taco experiences ( Tacolicious and Magdaluna ) , and this just paled in comparison , but I do n't think so . If Charlotte wants to be taken seriously as a World-Class city , we better put our big girl pants on and get some world-class cuisine . Smaller Durham and Chapel Hill even seem to be outpacing us . There 's no reason why this town ca n't have a really good taco place or good Chinese place , etc . There 's nothing magical about Californian tacos . At this point you can pretty much get every single ingredient here as you can there , so they should be just as good . Tex mex places especially have gotten lazy ( hear me , Picante , Vida and Maverick Rock Taco ? ? ) and think if you put any crap in a shell people will like it or eat it . Maybe it 's that most of these places do n't have that Mexican heritage ? I 'm trying to reach for a good reason . And no , I 'm not a haughty Californian- I 've now been in Charlotte longer than the Bay Area , so I 'm rooting for Charlotte to get better . Sometimes we all need a kick in the pants . \n\nSo , Bakersfield , sorry for the tangent , but if you want to get serious about having good food in addition to a cool bar , recruit the guy from Burrito Factory to come in to help you with your menu/sauces . Until then , we wo n't be back .",1,negative
"`` FAME is a legit concept , we just wished the food owned up to the name . The food advertised on the little papers are expensive and they look far from appetizing . We always walk in , take a gander at what they have to offer , but then quickly change our minds about dining here.\n\nWe 've also tried Fuku burger 's Tamago burger and jazz fries , but we were completely disappointed . Every flavor that we could taste was very salty . The burger did n't have any exciting pops of flavor and the fries became super swampy , soggy and terrible from the salt bombed gravy and mayo . The flavors were just too simple and fell flat on my asian fusion radar . We would try another one of their burger creations in the future , but we are definitely wary.\n\nThe reason why I 'm not hating too hard on FAME , is because they have an incredible location at the LINQ - right smack dab in the middle of thangs ! Plus , their \ '' '' '' '' Boba Lounge\ '' '' '' '' is not half bad . Their honey green tea is super refreshing and actually had a robust , full bodied , deep tea flavor . They also added the right amount of honey to sweeten it nicely . The boba itself is white/clear and had pops of reddish pink color which is really cool to look at , I just wished they cooked it properly . Most of the boba were super mushy and dissolved on contact , some were super chewy , and then there were a few boba that had the right consistency . The drink size is hefty , but for about $ 9 , I would n't make my way out here for it . But if I 'm in the immediate area and there 's a real life boba emergency - I would definitely dabble .

"So i can not count how many times i have been to this place ! pretty much once a month . The Real deal is to sit at the bar , so you can fully experience what is Kazu ! or let 's say Who is Kazu ! So last time i was there , i invited one of my friend who never been there before , one of the cook from Satay Brothers ( if you like Kazu you will love them aswell ) . it was his bday . We ordered probably 10 different things , A lot of food we had ! ! And so we could eat More , we decide to take option of eating nothing with rice . We started with the octopus and the Eggplant . \nOctopus was grilled and not overcooked , with perfect spices and a pretty big piece.\nEggplant was something amazing and reminded me of what my dad do . Spanish tapenade . \nWe took the Homemade Tofu , it is nothing special to it , you really got like Tofu and Texture , it was plain Soft Tofu with Soya Sauce . Its was more a Texture experience than anything else . \nTaki Gyoza is one of my favorite appetizer , and Edamane is a Must ! \nBeef Kalbi was perfect cooked , not too much , and was Tender serve with well balance salad . ( actually pretty much everything we had , was serve with a Salad ) \nWe order the grilled Mushrooms , I loved them and again its a texture experience . they had this mix of flavour , i guess because its cooked same grilled as all the meat and fish . I like it , maybe some people wouldnt appreciate it . \nWe order also the Fish Head , it took more time than the other meal , but was one of my fav dishes , we almost order another plate of Octopus but we decided to take the chicken skin and the beef carpaccio . I dont regret it : ) \nand we finish with Sake ice cream . \n\nI didnt drink , my frient had a glass of beer and i took Green Tea , that i really love there . Good Quality of Green Tea . \n\nAnd something you have to know ! Share with everyone the food you order , it is the good way of eating there , and order 1 or 2 plates at a time . Because they are really fast in preparing the meals , and the plates are big , and the tables are small . \n\nFinally the staff is great , i remember the waitress didnt know a word of french , and now they almost fully speak french . Kazu as the most seductive smile . and if you tell him your going come back tomorrow , he will have the cutest laugh ever ! \n\nI would go back only for his charming smile . : ) \n\noh i have mention , the price , for me its cheap , some consider expensive , but for everything we ate , we paid 140 $ all , that includes a 30 $ of tip",4,very positive

"Pin Kaow used to be my favorite Thai Place in all of Vegas . But we moved away , and when we came back after 5 years we discovered that things had changed , and I 'm afraid that it 's not for the better . \nTo be fair , the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations , and the waitresses now wear traditional Thai attire , which is very cool . \nBut the food portions are MUCH smaller , and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit , as well . ( perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations ? ) The Thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee , and nutrasweet . The spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside , and the chicken soup was VERY salty , which is a complaint that I rarely ever have , seeing as how I 'm a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to TOAST . ( I shit you , not . ) \nThe Pad See Ew and Pad Prik King were both TINY . \nNo , seriously ... .both were itty-bitty , teensy-weensy portions ... .maybe a cup worth of food per entree , at most . And honestly , the food just does n't seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be .

Decatur , which is even better than the old Pin Kaow ( which is saying a lot , because boy did Pin Kaow ever used to be good ! ) .",1,negative
"I hate bad haircuts so much that I refuse to get my hair cut for months after I move to a new city . I finally broke down after almost a year of not cutting my hair . I had a wedding to go to and did not want to look like a cave dweller . \n\nI walked into Veraldi on an impulse , and ran smack into Susan , the owner . She was on her way out , as they were closing for the day . All of the sudden , though I 'd waited months to consider a haircut , I felt panicked . I begged her to stay another few minutes , promising her that my hair would be so easy and so quick to cut . \n\nIt wasn't.\n\nAfter she agreed to stay to cut my hair , she continued working on it for the next half hour . It needed major help , and we both knew it . I winced as she finished , wondering what the damage would be , and then nearly hugged her when she told me . I walked out of Veraldi having only paid 35 dollars ( student discount off of 38 ! ) for one of the best haircuts of my life.\n\nI looked so fabulous at the wedding . Susan , you are a genius and a lifesaver , and I 'm NEVER going to anyone else in this city .",3,positive
Was n't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp . But their deep fried King Crab was delicious ! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful .,2,neutral
"Never returning to this place again ! I was really disappointed with the way the staff treats the customers . They told me one price when I went in and a totally different price when it was time to pay . Moreover , the staff tends to talk in their own language , which I find very disrespectful .",0,very negative
"I ordered 2 dishes.\n\nGreen Curry Chicken - tasted okay , quality of food was good . overall good , but i did n't like how expensive it was . maybe its because there are n't many thai restaurants that they can charge a lot , but i 've had much better elsewhere for much cheaper.\n\nBasil Beef - I 've never had basil beef that was served with ground beef ! I usually get pieces/slices of beef , but this place served it with ground beef . after i realized it was ground beef , i had only a little bit since it did n't taste all that good.\n\nadvice : do n't order beef dishes , go with the chicken .",1,negative
"The medium golden wings are flawless EVERY time we order them . The Focaccias ( sp ? ) are delicious , although the ingredients do n't seem to be consistent . Beer is good . I love beer , and they serve lots of it in BIG mugs . Mmmm beer . Good . The taco salad is always good too . My son loves all the food here ... whatever hits the table he eats . I love that we can substitute fries & rings with a salad , and the kid meals have a choice for carrot sticks as a side- LOVE that . The only thing that bothers me is being charged for salad dressing . One side comes with your order , but you have to pay for extra ... if 3 people are sharing wings that becomes annoying .",3,positive
"`` I do n't understand how this place has so many stars , it 's definitely not a 4 star establishment . Bottom line - it 's not worth the price . I ordered the fez salad ; it 's basically two handfuls of field greens , three halves of CANNED pears , barely a tablespoon of goat cheese , and a few slivers of almonds . The menu clearly states \ '' '' '' '' cinnamon marinated pears\ '' '' '' '' , such bullshit . Totally false advertising . My husband ordered the bleu cheese burger , the patty had the texture of meatloaf ( gross ) .\n\nThey need to hire real kitchen staff who will prepare what is on the menu . ''",1,negative

"`` Are you kidding me ? ? ? This old school clip joint has n't the class to admit women without a male \ '' '' '' '' escort.\ '' '' '' '' The pee-on counting cabs in the driveway turned us away on my Birthday ! Not only that , but he could not give me a reason why , then insulted me with the obligatory \ '' '' '' '' sorry sweetie.\ '' '' '' '' What a joke ! If a top \ '' '' '' '' gentleman 's club\ '' '' '' '' is turning away female clients , then it must be because the management is n't secure in their own manhood ! Needless to say , we went elsewhere and were greeted warmly , by the doorman , the waitresses and the dancers ! Not to mention the hot lap dance and loads of attention from all the ladies ! The Spearmint Rhino and their male staff are turning away good money in an effort to remain in power over their dancers . I say this because every woman at the other club said how much the LOVE FEMALE CLIENTS ! \n\n So ladies ... When in Vegas do n't bother with a visit to the Rhino ! ! ! Head elsewhere and enjoy the show ! ''",0,very negative
"`` Why oh why did it take me so long to discover Padre 's ? \nBeing a huge fan of modern Mexican cuisine , I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food served at Padre 's . I found them to be in the same family as Dick 's or Sierra Bonita , muy bueno ! \n\nThe outside of the building is a bit deceiving and the parking is pretty tight . I was n't quite prepared for what we stepped in to . Came on a Friday night and chose to sit in the dining area ( my date tried to opt for the huge patio , but it was far to windy for that ) . The band Cascabel was playing in the bar area , and the music and volume were the perfect enrichment to our dining pleasure . \n\nWe started with the jalapeno-bacon wrapped scallops and they were to die for . The bacon was cooked in jalapenos wich gave it just the right bite at the end . The scallops surrounded a pesto risotto and sat in a roasted red pepper cream sauce . The pesto risotto was not only delicious , but a delightful surprise at a \ '' '' '' '' Mexican Restaurant\ '' '' '' '' . \nFor our meal we shared the modern cowboy steak , a 12oz . grilled rib eye , guajillo mashed potatoes , sauteed garlic spinach and again with the delicious roasted red pepper cream . I really loved the mashed potatoes , they were red from all the chili seasoning and absolutely perfect . \n\nI washed all this down with a sangria and although it was a bit tart ( tasted like they used a sweet and sour mixer ) it was still decent . \nThe multiple rooms in the restaurant keep it intimate , while the bar area provides a more lively atmosphere . The service was excellent , I ca n't wait to return for HH ! ''",3,positive

"The most important thing to me in an airline is that we do not fall out of the sky in an uncontrolled fashion . After all landing is a controlled crash . So far they have done well in this area.\n\nIt seems each flight I have had with this airline the seat is not working as it should . It always leans back and will not set straight . One gets tired of telling the attendant that no I can not bring the seat up to upright position . This last flight seat was quite uncomfortable , my rump was sore soon after we took off . This is the second thing past crashing that I think an airline should consider , comfort of the seating area . Arriving back in Phoenix one goes to pick up the checked bag . one waits and waits and waits some more , two other flights that landed since we arrived have come and gone . A bunch of grumpy tired travelers is not a pretty sight to behold , Luckily they only had to look over at me to see the face of calm and patience ; - { ) We finally got home at 12:01 am after landing at 10:40 p.m.\n\nBut hey we did not crash so they are A-OK with me.\n\nOh and we know airlines do not pamper anymore , well unless we are on an international flight . So we know to take what we need to keep us happy in the air .",2,neutral
"All Ajs are the same , you pretty much know what you are getting into when you walk in . \n\nI have to tell you about this one specifically though . I get lunch here all the time in between shifts from work . AJs is close and they always get my in and out with a quickness . \n\nTheir sandwich 's are supper yummy , the chunky chicken salad or tuna are great choices . They also have a great salad bar . Anything you could want ; roman , mixed greens , ice berg , radishes , three different cheeses , black beans , corn , salami , egg , carrots , cucumber , olives , tomato , croutons , and three or four different dressings . They charge you by wight , so depending on your appetite it 's pretty affordable . \n\nI have never tried their sushi , but they looks great , fresh and a really great variety . Again , the iced tea is awesome . \n\nDue to the kick butt work out and diet I have been committed to lately I have n't been able to frequent the pastry and sweets counter . But you only have to take one look to know it all looks amazing . Tastes amazing too . My favorites are the lemon bars and Napoleons and fruit tarts . Grab some treats from here to take to your next dinner party , you will make their night !",3,positive
"I came here tonight because I was hungry and wanted a variety of food to choose from . The prices here are fair , and the food selections pretty darn good . The salad bar is awesome , with tons of fresh fruit , toppings , dressings and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nThe first time I came here I ate like it was going out of style and really liked the food . They have a sushi bar , but the selection 's limited . They also have a grill where they cook stuff like it 's a Mongolian grill , and its not half bad.\n\nSometimes the drink refills are slow , and I will admit , even though the food is good , some dishes are better then others . Definitely a good place to go eat at with a good selection and great prices .",2,neutral

"My friends used to make fun of me for going here for manicures . Now , they 're all regulars . Though this little nail spa is n't glamourous , the service is top-notch . I never have a complaint after visiting Dynasty and I always walk out with the best manicures and pedicures . There 's always a plethora of polishes to choose from and I 've rarely had to wait more than five minutes for a service . \n\nThe technicians are extremely kind and welcoming and always take their time while providing services . I never feel like they are rushing to get me in and out . The prices are affordable ( $ 35 for a manicure and pedicure ) . The spa recently got a facelift , so the inside looks even cleaner and more pleasant than it did before . If you 're seeking a no-fuss manicure and pedicure , this is the spot for you .",3,positive
"this place has seen better days . perhaps it used to be nicer , but it is n't anything special now . the rooms are ok , but the beds and furniture are somewhat worn . they just underwent a minor renovation , but it appears it was n't enough . i have since discovered there are better deals , and nicer hotels right off the same exit .",1,negative
"I have been here several times and each time it has been a great experience . I am sort of a makeup junkie , especially Bare Escentuals ( I 've pretty much been a loyalist since I was a teenager ) and everyone here is so knowledgeable about the products . Returns/exchanges have always been easy as well . I also appreciate how they do n't work on commission , that they just want to give you products that you need/want to spend on . \n\nThe selection and kits here are awesome . A word of warning to anyone thinking about converting : never fall in love with anything from a kit . The colors are often just kit-specific and do n't exist as individual products . ( Love u , citrine radiance . come back to me , pls . ) \n\nIf ever you want to try mineral makeup , BE is where it 's at . Do n't go for the cheap stuff , because it wo n't last and wo n't give you the result that you want -- believe me , I have tried to get out of spending $ 27 per unit of foundation and it just is n't the same ! Try it out -- they take everything back with receipts and have a very generous , flexible return policy !",4,very positive
"Good food at an amazing price . That being said , they seem to be working out the kinks of a new restaurant , which makes it hard to give it a fourth star . The drinks and appetizers were excellent , but my entree was a real struggle to get through . It was a parsnip cream sauce over excellent fresh pasta , but the parsnip sauce was very bitter and bland . Salt was requested to take the edge off , which apparently is frowned upon since it took maybe 10 minutes for the waiter to bring me a shot glass with a few salt crystals . Food snobbery like this is n't that offensive to me , but when the restaurant does n't yet have quality control in place to ensure they are n't serving old parsnips , which I am guessing is what happened to those of us unfortunate enough to order the pasta that night , it is really disappointing . All this aside , the space is great , and the quality of the rest of the dishes was enough to make me want to try again .",2,neutral

"`` While on vacation , my iPad 3 was not recognizing the SIM card , so I made an appointment at the Genius Bar at Fashion Show.\n\nI got there on time , but absolutely no employee would look at me . A de facto line had formed on the side , and employees were moving from person to person , so I waited patiently until it was my turn . Then , the lady behind me shoved her way in front of me , and I continued to be ignored.\n\nAt this point , I was already aggravated , so I interrupted an employee who was on his way to helping a customer and begged him to help me or at least get me checked in . Another 10 minutes passed ( now about 25 minutes after my appointment time ) before some emo Apple Store employee with gauges in his ears came to help me.\n\nAfter examining my iPad , he informed me that it would cost $ 300 to fix it , because it was 3 weeks out of warranty . I let out an expletive then immediately apologized for my language , but I was still quite perturbed . He told me , \ '' '' '' '' Electronics are just like that.\ '' '' '' '' He then informed me I should sell my iPad as a WiFi-only device and use the money to buy a new one . My reaction ? \ '' '' '' '' Are you kidding me ? I am never buying another Apple product again ! \ '' '' '' '' \n\nAt this point , I defiantly pulled out my Samsung Galaxy S4 to document my experience for all 17 people who follow me on social media sites . He rushed off to find a manager , as I angrily yet easily typed away due to the beauty of Swype . A few minutes later , he reappeared and said that his manager agreed to replace my iPad for free , since it was obvious that it was well cared for with no hint of water damage ( true ) and they did not want me to have a bad impression of Apple . Sounds nice , right ? However , he was going to to try just one more thing to try to fix the problem.\n\nWell , after about five minutes ... would n't you know ... my iPad was magically repaired ! Shady AF . I am sure many of you reading this think I 'm a huge biznatch and should just gratefully bow down at the Steve Jobs altar , but that actually ticked me off even more . First of all , why did n't he try that in the first place ? Second , if I had been really passive ( as believe it or not , I often am ) and accepted his initial diagnosis , I would have paid $ 300 for a two-generation old iPad.\n\nMy experience here reinforced a sad yet true reality of today 's world : sometimes to get the best service , you have to be an a-hole .
