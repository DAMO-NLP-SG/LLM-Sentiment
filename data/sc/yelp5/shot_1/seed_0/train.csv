"I finally stopped in True Food Kitchen for a quick bite to eat with 2 kids . I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole ( I love spaghetti squash ) and the kids ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and ravioli . I really liked my spaghetti squash - just right portion size and very tasty . The kids teriyaki bowl with quinoa was excellent ! ! The ravioli was a bit small portion-wise , and was n't as appealing as the teriyaki , but still good.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly - which we appreciated since we were on a tight schedule . We were here at 4pm though , so there was hardly anyone in the restaurant . Nice atmosphere , and the patio was lovely ( although we did n't sit out there because it was August ) . The bill was $ 30 , which seems a bit steep considering I did n't have anything but water . I guess that 's what you pay in Scottsdale Quarter for fresh , organic food though . Still , it just seems a bit overpriced .",3,positive
"Now I know the idea here is to be a southern style smokehouse . But I hate to be the one to break the bad news to the nice people of Bofingers , but there 's more to it than putting meat in a smoker and waiting . \n\nI 've been to this restaurant two times , and both times I left disappointed . The idea is good , but they did n't succeed in creating something memorable .",1,negative
"I got a facial and they did not have sheets on the table . Literally there was only a blanket and a table pad . I did n't pay much attention to this until after my service when I saw the same blanket being used for a person after me . The man at the counter who is apparently Ashley 's husband was rude and was having a loud conversation about sports with another man in the spa . It is a spa setting and I just felt that it was unprofessional when I came there to relax and have a pampering day . Additionally , he quoted me the wrong price for the mani/pedi and only told me after the service when I was paying that he was mistaken about the price . I heard Ashley is great , but I had another aesthetician and she was also great for the facial . Place was clean , but I 'm giving them only 3 stars because I got a mani/ pedi and they had very limited colors . It was uncomfortable not to have a foot stool in the room they use for the mani/pedi . Man/ husband was unprofessional and it really was distasteful .",2,neutral
"EPIC FAIL ! \n\nWow , what a complete disappointment ! HORRIBLE service ! \n\nWe ( 2 of us ) went in a little after noon on a Sunday for lunch . It was my first time trying a Wing Stop and I was super disappointed . The store hours say they open at 11am , but when we walked in after noon they were still setting things up and took several minutes to come to the counter to greet us . They were nice enough , but it took over 20 minutes to get our food.\n\nOver 20 minutes for hot wings is ridiculous . Then to add insult to injury one of the two orders of fries was so over salted it was inedible . They replaced the fries without any hassle , but all the fries were not cooked the same . They were cut all oddball with some skinny and some thick , so some were overcooked and some undercooked.\n\nThe wings were decent , but nothing impressive . I have had better at several other wing places . There are too many places that make good wings and have good service to ever go here again.\n\nI have a hunch the reason for the bad service was no management . I did n't see any manager in the store . Everyone looked college age and while it is certainly possible a college age person could be a manager , nobody in that store acted like one . \n\nSteer clear if you want good food with good service .",0,very negative
Met these guys at a Yelp party . The crab cake slider was wonderful . Tons of flavor . Also had a steak slider that was very good but the crab cake stole the show ! The owners were very friendly . I 'll be looking for these guys next time I 'm in Charlotte ! ! !,4,very positive
