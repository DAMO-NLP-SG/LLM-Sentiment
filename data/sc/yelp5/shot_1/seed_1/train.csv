"I love kitchen stores , and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh . Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware . None of them are really any good for any of us . I wo n't get into what the dangers of them are , but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware , Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8 , 10 , and 12 inch pans . Like non stick , no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca . If you love stainless steel cookware , they have anything you want from All Clad , made right in Canonsburg Pa . There 's Fiesta ware from Wheeling , and If you want Emeral 's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well , they have a full service kitchen in back . Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space , but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they 've prepped . \n\nIt 's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices . But well worth it !",3,positive
We tried a few burgers which were decent for fast food ( although I would prefer Wendy 's ) and their milkshake which was tasty & of good consistency .,2,neutral
"I just called to place a very last minute order and spoke with Michelle , one of the owners and I can not express my thanks and gratitude enough for the most excellent customer service I received . I know that the 50th Anniversary shirts ordered will be amazing and that I will never use another printing company based on what I just experienced . Thank you so very much to Michelle ! ! !",4,very positive
"`` I went to My Mother 's for dinner with a large group of family members ( 16 ) , including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old . While the decor was generically bad \ '' '' '' '' down-home\ '' '' '' '' from the 80 's , the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.\n\nThe meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft . This gave me hope that the meal would n't be in keeping with the general feel of the place . Alas , my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.\n\nAfter ordering , I made my way to the salad bar . This seemed quaint , considering that salad bars are n't really popular anymore , unless you 're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes . The salad bar was not entirely scary , but was n't anything worth going back to . I 'm fairly certain everything came out of a can , bag , bottle or box . The freshest thing may have been the red onion , which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.\n\nMoving on to the main course , I had Mother 's Meat Loaf dinner . My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans . Once again , food from cans and boxes made an appearance , as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix . The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat , but was n't all that exciting . It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top , yet was served with gravy on the side ( probably originally made from a powder mix ) . I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry , not because of the quality.\n\nHoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state , I ordered pie for dessert . They tout their homemade pies , but seem to think that \ '' '' '' '' homemade\ '' '' '' '' means making pie from canned ingredients . My cherry pie was not spectacular , as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light , flaky and buttery , but only managed to be dry and chewy.\n\nMy Mother 's was saved from a one-star rating by two things ... the graciousness and patience of the staff , and the low prices . For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I , our total bill including tax and tip was $ 35.\n\nMy advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother 's Restaurant .

"`` This limo almost hit a few people while speeding thru the parking lot and then blocked traffic in a fire zone.\n\nI called Presidential Limo and asked their dispatch to move the limo out of the fire zone.\n\nDispatch told me to just call 911 - they were not going to contact the driver.\nI asked for a supervisor and was told no . Someone in the background said \ '' '' '' '' Just tell him to fucking call 911\ '' '' '' '' .\n\nVery unprofessional and unsafe.\n\nI did call 911 and reported it , as suggested.\n\nMetro did arrive and the limo was moved.\n\nLicense PRES203 ''",0,very negative
