"The most important thing to me in an airline is that we do not fall out of the sky in an uncontrolled fashion . After all landing is a controlled crash . So far they have done well in this area.\n\nIt seems each flight I have had with this airline the seat is not working as it should . It always leans back and will not set straight . One gets tired of telling the attendant that no I can not bring the seat up to upright position . This last flight seat was quite uncomfortable , my rump was sore soon after we took off . This is the second thing past crashing that I think an airline should consider , comfort of the seating area . Arriving back in Phoenix one goes to pick up the checked bag . one waits and waits and waits some more , two other flights that landed since we arrived have come and gone . A bunch of grumpy tired travelers is not a pretty sight to behold , Luckily they only had to look over at me to see the face of calm and patience ; - { ) We finally got home at 12:01 am after landing at 10:40 p.m.\n\nBut hey we did not crash so they are A-OK with me.\n\nOh and we know airlines do not pamper anymore , well unless we are on an international flight . So we know to take what we need to keep us happy in the air .",2,neutral
"`` Great place to go for hair , nails or massage . Great service in a professional and clean environment . Most places u have to wait even if u have an appt . Brandi , who is also the owner did a color touch up and she went the extra mile w/o charging the \ '' '' '' '' extra\ '' '' '' '' $ $ $ . And the neck massage when she rinsed my hair was fabulous . Check them out , you wo n't regret it : ) ''",4,very positive
"My friends used to make fun of me for going here for manicures . Now , they 're all regulars . Though this little nail spa is n't glamourous , the service is top-notch . I never have a complaint after visiting Dynasty and I always walk out with the best manicures and pedicures . There 's always a plethora of polishes to choose from and I 've rarely had to wait more than five minutes for a service . \n\nThe technicians are extremely kind and welcoming and always take their time while providing services . I never feel like they are rushing to get me in and out . The prices are affordable ( $ 35 for a manicure and pedicure ) . The spa recently got a facelift , so the inside looks even cleaner and more pleasant than it did before . If you 're seeking a no-fuss manicure and pedicure , this is the spot for you .",3,positive
"Great pub ! So why only two stars ? Utterly horrible management . Do n't even consider entering the doors unless you are a middle class conventional clone , as they will ask you to leave unless you are dressed correctly in their eyes , speaking in the right accent , and behaving 'correctly ' . Oh , and do n't you dare fail to fill in their obscure food-ordering slips absolutely correctly , or prepare to be soundly scolded by the ridiculously snobbish staff . Pity , the place itself is worth a look , despite the seriously excessive prices . But the people who run it make it a 'never go back ' experience unless you love to be humiliated by snobs .",1,negative
"`` Hello there ! \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My name is Naiby Moreno , and the reason why I 'm writing you this email is because last night , around this time , I was at your location in 4409 E. McKellips Rd , Mesa AZ , 85215 , and I placed an order for a few drinks where my bill came up to a little over $ 20.00 , unfortunately , I lost my receipt so , it 's hard for me to give you the accurate information , however , I asked the cashier who took my order and realized later that it was the Store Mgr , if I could get my drinks in your reusable plastic cups , to what she said , \ '' '' '' '' No problem , \ '' '' '' '' \ '' '' '' '' it will be $ 1.00 each , \ '' '' '' '' so , I said , \ '' '' '' '' Yes , that 's fine\ '' '' '' '' . Since I ordered some frappuccinos , the barista gave me some dome lids and told me , that they were giving me those covers because of the whipped cream , and he also said , but we 'll give you the plastic lids on the side , we are just looking for them , so , I said , perfect ! , my kids and I sat down , and started drinking our drinks , waiting also to get our plastic covers , about 10 minutes had passed by , and I saw the two baristas and the mgr , talking and brewing coffee , but nobody looking for any lids , so I went to the register and ordered an extra item which was a double chocolate chip brownie , so , the same blonde girl who was the \ '' '' '' '' MGR\ '' '' '' '' , took my order again , and I asked her if they had my lids for my cups , because we did need them , so , she gave me a sarcastic look and said , \ '' '' '' '' Oh , I am looking for them\ '' '' '' '' , so , I said , ok , thanks . I went back to my chair and sat down again , and waited , and waited and waited , another 10 to 15 minutes had passed by , so , finally she came out and told us that they did n't have any lids for the cups , but that she was calling some stores to see if they could borrow some from them , so , I said , ok , by this time , I was already getting upset about the fact that she was almost ignoring me , because she did n't even say \ '' '' '' '' SORRY\ '' '' '' '' , and it just seemed that she did n't care , \u00a0 and still I was trying to be nice and asked her if there was any other store around to where she could call and ask to give them to me , if it was on my way home , to what she replied , \ '' '' '' '' I am calling them\ '' '' '' '' , so , again , she went back inside , and again , I waited another 5 minutes , finally she came back again holding one plastic lid and laughing she said , \ '' '' '' '' So , I only have one lid for your cups , but I there is this other store at McDowell and Power , and they have the other lids for you , you just have to go and get them\ '' '' '' '' . Really ? ? ? , is that how you suppose to fix your problems , now , that and her careless attitude pissed me off , so , right after she said that to me I replied with a \ '' '' '' '' and you are the mgr , \ '' '' '' '' and she said yes , and I said , \ '' '' '' '' and you 're sorry ? , because you never said sorry\ '' '' '' '' , so we started arguing when she said \ '' '' '' '' yes I did\ '' '' '' '' , and I said \ '' '' '' '' No you didn't\ '' '' '' '' . After this , I said , in my receipt says that I can get a refund if I do n't want the items , and she said , fine I will give you a refund . I mentioned to her that I was a mgr at a coffee shop as well , and I knew about customer service standards , and I told her that what she was doing was n't the right way of fixing a problem , to what she did n't like , I told her , \ '' '' '' '' you as a Mgr , should know better that if you are out of plastic lids for your cups , you should n't even be selling them , or at least you need to let the customer know about the inconvenience . I asked my kids to finish their drinks because we were returning the cups that I had just purchased for them , because they had no lids for them , thus , we were not going to be able to use them to carry hot coffee , I went back to the register and gave your Mgr the cups that she threw away in the trash can in front of me , splashing milk everywhere around , then she asked me if I was keeping the one cup with the lid , and I said well , yes , my other daughter went home already , so , I ca n't returned that one , so , after going back in the transaction in the system and refunded me for 4 cups , she stated that my total was $ 4.08 then she said , my bad your total is actually less because I gave you \u00a2.10 off each drink , again I said , ok , that was a discount on THE DRINKS not on the cups , and she argued again and said yes , but thats how the system works , so , honestly and at that point I did n't care anymore of what she was doing or saying , I just told her WHATEVER , just give me my money back , I just want to leave this place , so she did , then she made me sign a refund ticket , to proof the transaction , so I signed , and when I was leaving the location , I reminded her , to remove the cups from the display or to at least let her customer know about the inconvenience.\n\u00a0I am sorry , if I made this look like such a big deal , but coming from the management of food industry , I know my rights as a customer and I expect respect and good service , why , because I am paying for my product , I never asked for anything free , just some good service , obviously my question is : What kind of service are your crew members suppose to give , when the Mgr acts that way they wo n't care , right ? , ''",0,very negative
